<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class='mini' />

<p>
The Editor of this little volume does not
deem it incumbent upon him to explain
in what way the author&#8217;s manuscript came
into his possession. He hopes it may be
enough for him to say, that the writer believed
himself to be the only person whose
memory retained most of the incidents and
anecdotes herein recorded; and a long
and familiar acquaintance with his character
enables the Editor to state, that entire
credence is due to his narrative of facts,
written down as occurring within his own
knowledge and to his relation of whatever
he alleges himself to have derived
from others. A slight veil of mystery
seems to have been originally thrown over
the story; especially in regard to the
names of persons; but, as all who are
familiar<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_iv'  name='page_iv'></a>iv</span> with the locality will at once recognize
its general features, the Editor has
thought it best, for the benefit of others
not so well informed, to make all proper
explanations on this point in the Index.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, New England has been
spoken of as devoid of the elements of
romance; but perhaps this idea may be
owing to the fact, that the means of presenting
a different aspect of the case have
not been sufficiently investigated. A similar
impression has prevailed in respect to
Roman history and literature, whether fabulous
or otherwise; and the fathers of New
England, at least, have been thought to
have exhibited some of the traits, especially
the simplicity and severity of character,
which distinguished those more ancient
worthies, whose names and deeds have been
so long famous. But without making other
citations, I may remark, that I am scarcely
acquainted with a poem more thoroughly
romantic in conception and sentiment, than
&#8220;Gallus,&#8221;<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_v'  name='page_v'></a>v</span> the tenth eclogue of Virgil; and
Macaulay, in his &#8220;Lays of Ancient Rome,&#8221;
has turned some of its legends to fine poetical
account. Where can be found, for instance,
a prettier, or more suggestive picture,
than the passage in his &#8220;Virginia,&#8221;
which some inspired painter might make
immortal upon canvas, as it is in verse:&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>
<tr><td><p>
&#8220;With her small tablets in her hand, and her satchel on her arm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Home she went bounding from the school, nor dreamed of shame or harm.&#8221;
</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Perhaps, the solemnities of the colonial
history of New England may have overshadowed
much of whatever poetical interest
might be discovered in its private annals.
It depends upon the reader, whether
the present narrative may be thought in
some measure to qualify the imputation in
question.

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p>
It was the winter of 18&mdash;, between fifty
and sixty years ago. Certainly the winters
of New England began earlier and were
more severe than they have seemed at a
later period. After the fervid heat of summer
has become subdued by the progressive
changes of the season, no atmosphere
could be clearer, purer, more exhilarating
than the prevailing tone of our October
days, and this kindly influence, as if by
way of preparing the human frame for the
gradual approach of winter, generally extends,
with occasional stormy intermissions,
through November, and often very far into
the frosty domain of December itself. And
such snow-storms as we once endured! It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
may be alleged, that distance of time forbids
accuracy of comparison, and that
masses of snow, which appeared vast to a
child, would not seem so immense to a full-grown
man, and were really no more huge
than some of those with which winter nowadays
envelopes the ground. But facts
within my memory do not admit of such
an explanation, for I distinctly recollect the
driving storm which continued for days and
piled its accumulating heaps against the
front of our dwelling-place, so as entirely
to cover the windows of the lower story of
the house, and to rise above the main door
which was of ordinary height, and that at
length we were released from this imprisonment
by means of an archway to that entrance,
dug through the drift by the friendly
efforts of an opposite neighbor.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
Our deliverer was a superannuated seaman;
inspired partly, no doubt, by the good-heartedness
formerly, at least, thought to
be characteristic of that class of men, and,
partly, by respect for the memory of my
father, who had been dead for some years,
in the early prime of life, leaving behind
him the best of reputations as a shipmaster
and a man. Perhaps Tom Trudge had,
at some time, sailed under him. I well remember
the triumphant air with which this
ancient mariner introduced himself into the
kitchen, where all the family was assembled,
doffing his tarpaulin, flourishing his shovel,
and cutting one or two capers, in token of
his hilarity at the accomplishment of his
somewhat arduous job. Of course, there
were profuse thanks and congratulations
on the occasion; but I recollect only, that,
after the second glass of grog furnished by
my mother,&mdash;a refreshment to which Tom
was only too partial,&mdash;he executed another
spring from the floor, snapped his fingers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
and cried, &#8220;Tired, ma&#8217;am!&mdash;not a bit of
it! For all I&#8217;ve done to-day, by the blessed
binnacle I should think nothing at all of
jumping over a meetin-us,&mdash;yes, a meetin-us,
ma&#8217;am!&#8221; to the amazement, at the idea
of such a feat, of certainly all the younger
fry who were present at the ceremony.
</p>
<p>
The town in which we lived was one of
the very oldest of the New England settlements.
Its situation is uncommonly beautiful,
upon a slope descending from a moderately
elevated ridge towards the bank of
a noble river, which of late years has furnished
more motive power to various manufacturing
establishments in the towns and
villages, which have sprung up on its borders,
than any other stream in the world.
At the time of which I write, there was not
a mill throughout its whole extent. It is
told, that Louis Philippe, when a fugitive
in this country, in his youth, passing up the
road which leads mostly along the margin
of the river to a point where the first falls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
interrupt the navigation, pronounced the
scenery the most beautiful he had ever
seen. The river was then chiefly famous
for the rafts of admirable timber which it
sent down from the primeval forests above,
for the construction of the unsurpassed
ships built near the town, and for the commerce
flourishing upon its bosom and extending
to every quarter of the globe. It
was idle enough, in comparison, at a later
period.
</p>
<p>
Early in the present century, and for a
long series of years in the past, no town on
the American coast surpassed it in commercial
enterprise and activity. The habits
and traditions of the place were well calculated
to nurse a hardy race of seamen, and
their reputation for skill and courage was
well known throughout the maritime world.
Persons are very apt to look at some direct
circumstance, nearest at hand, for the cause
of events, which may after all result from
much more remote contingencies. So, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
first, in the days of the declining trade of
the town, they said the obstruction to its
commerce was owing to the sand-bar at
the mouth of the river. But the bar had
been there from time immemorial; and
though it is true that modern-built vessels,
with their cargoes, could not pass that barrier,
as ships of lesser tonnage were formerly
accustomed to do, yet the main
cause for this decay of business was to be
found in the growth of the capital of the
State, and the greater facilities for the
transaction of business which exist in
larger than in smaller places.
</p>
<p>
But the bar itself was always of very dangerous
passage in boisterous weather, and
often the daring pilots of the station, than
whom none upon the coast were more competent
and courageous, were exposed to extreme
peril, in their small craft, in returning
to the river, when they had been on the
look-out for inward-bound vessels in the
bay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
</p>
<p>
It so happened that a schooner in which
I was a passenger, when a youngster, was
detained outside the bar, and was likely to
be detained for several hours, waiting for
the tide to make. A young pilot, accompanied
by his still younger brother, came
alongside in their whale-boat, and having
some acquaintance with me invited me to
sail with them to town; and, having been
some time absent from home, I gladly accepted
their offer. Their boat was under a
single low sail. The breeze was fresh and
the day fair, though I could not but be
aware, as we bowled along towards the bar,
that a retreating storm had left some indications
of its past presence in the tossing
foam that sprang upwards as the waves
dashed upon that treacherous heap of shifting
sand. The pilot sat in the stern-sheets
of the dancing boat, steering steadily with
an oar. His brother tended the sail, and
I was crouched amidships. As we approached
nearer the scene of commotion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
our younger companion assumed a station
in the bow of the boat and began to sound
with an oar. This looked a little formidable
to a landsman; and soon turning his head
in the interval of hastily pushing his implement
into the water, the bowsman called
out to his brother, &#8220;Joe, are you going to
try it?&#8221; Joe made no sign, but steered
steadily on. Again and again the sounding
oar went rapidly down, and I suppose
at last to the bottom, and again the young
man cried out with renewed energy, &#8220;Joe,
are you going to try it?&#8221; Joe uttered no
word, but chewing his quid, looked steadfastly
forward. In a moment a heavy wave
struck the boat, drenching us plentifully,
but not filling her, and bounding up, staggering
a little, she dashed on, and with
another like slap or two, we were over and
in fairly smooth water. Had the boat
struck bottom, she would have been instantly
dashed to pieces and we should
have met the sad fate of others who, before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
and since, have been drowned and lost to
sight forever in that seething tide.
</p>
<p>
In a conversation with a very eminent
English novelist, of profounder skill and
more permanent fame, in my opinion, than
any other since Scott, he expressed his surprise
at the solid aspect of the city of Boston,
in which we had met, on the day after
his arrival in this country, upon his first lecturing
tour. He had enjoyed the best opportunities
of viewing &#8220;men and cities,&#8221;
not only in Europe, but in various parts of
the farther East. I took the liberty of replying
that Boston had been growing nearly
two centuries and a half, and inquired if
he expected to see wigwams, or even those
slighter fabrics which betoken the earlier
stages of advancing colonization. He said,
&#8220;No, of course not; but it had quite as
substantial an appearance as an English
city.&#8221; But it is to be remembered that the
persons who came to this country, at first,
and from time to time, afterwards, were already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
civilized, and brought with them and
transmitted to their descendants much of
the knowledge and many of the habits,
peculiarities, and even the traditions of
their ancestors &#8220;at home.&#8221; Our town, too,
looked old; though far from being so substantially
built as Boston.
</p>
<p>
In fact, while reading the fragment of
Scott&#8217;s autobiography of his earlier days,
and Dean Ramsay&#8217;s &#8220;Reminiscences,&#8221; one
might almost think that their descriptions
of character and manners, in so ancient a
city as Edinburgh, were in many respects
but a recapitulation of popular ways and
even of personal oddities in our own respectable
American town. Especially, the
great novelist&#8217;s vivid narrative of the desperate
street conflicts between the lads of
the several quarters of the &#8220;auld town,&#8221;
revives many boyish recollections. In my
youth, the division was into Northenders
and Southenders; but as our own residence
was in the central part of the town,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
we stood, as it were, between two fires.
The conflicts usually took place in the winter,
when the snow was on the ground, and
though heartily engaged in, and sometimes
quite too rough for play, were generally
good-natured enough to avoid any very
serious danger to life or limb. In the
higher schools, the lads were drawn from
every quarter of the town; but upon dismissal
for the day, or upon the afternoons
of Wednesday and Saturday, when no
school was kept, the partisans of the several
sections offered combat which was seldom
refused. The usual weapons were
snow-balls, which were sometimes, I regret
to say, dipped in water and frozen over
night, and kept in some secure place to await
the expected battle, and occasionally a pebble,
the missile commonly used by the Scottish
combatants, was inserted,&mdash;a practice
which was almost universally condemned.
Very seldom did we come to a hand-fight,
for a spirited &#8220;rush,&#8221; when either party felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
strong enough for it, was almost always
followed by a rapid retreat on the other
side. But woe to the luckless stripling
whose headlong courage carried him far in
advance of his companions; for upon a
sudden turn of affairs he was a captive,
and down in an instant, and mercilessly
&#8220;scrubbed&#8221; with snow by a dozen ready
hands, until the rallying host of his compatriots
advanced vigorously to the rescue.
The normal alliance of us middle-men was
with the Southenders, though a good deal
rougher than ourselves; and in times of
truce a solitary boy would walk a little gingerly
through their quarter, as errands or
family occasions led him that way. But
the principal commercial interests centered
in those parts of the town, and if, upon the
breaking out of determined warfare, we
could secure, in the capacity of leader, the
services of some lubberly boy who had
made a voyage, even a mere coasting trip,
to sea, though I remember that these were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
sometimes far less adventurous in the field
than those who had no experience of the
perilous deep, the issue of the contest was
not for a moment doubtful. The forces of
our adversaries melted away, like the snow
with which they fought, at the very presence
of a champion supposed to be of such
redoubted prowess. The dependence of
those adverse combatants was rather upon
some of the younger hangers-on at the
ship-yards, in their territory, for such a casual
auxiliary. Sometimes, the elements of
military skill would be displayed. While
the two forces were closely engaged, a
flanking party would make a sudden rush
up some short by-street, and then the complete
demoralization and panic-flight of the
warriors thus newly assailed was something
truly disastrous to behold.
</p>
<p>
Of course, we enjoyed the ordinary boyish
sports of boating, swimming, and skating
in the season for it; or, of a pleasant
afternoon, would roam away &#8220;over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
hills,&#8221; as the phrase ran, huckleberrying,
perhaps, or gathering penny-royal and other
wild herbs for the old folks at home; to
be dried and reserved for future occasions.
For, in those days, a garret would hardly
be considered complete, without bunches
of these simples hanging from the beams
by strings, or stored away in paper-bags.
In the fall of the year, we had another resource,
long since interdicted by the owners
of farms in the neighborhood of populous
towns. This was the pleasure of nutting;
for the urchins of those days regarded
these kinds of fruit, growing on trees in
the fields, as a sort of <i>feræ natura</i> and free
to every passer-by; though the more surly
proprietors, even then, took much pains to
circumvent and capture the lads, as they
returned with their poles for beating the
branches and with their loaded bags, borne
by two or three of them, hanging by the
middle across those implements. Sometimes,
predatory bands proceeded in force
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
and defied the farmer on his own ground.
The story was told of one luckless individual
who went nutting alone and was caught
and imprisoned, for a time, in the cellar of
the farm-house, but mischievously contrived
to set all the taps of the cider-barrels running,
before he was released. These excursions
led us often to the Devil&#8217;s Den, an
excavation in an abandoned ledge of limestone,
in a solitary situation at some distance
from the town, and guarded, now as
then, by three rather spectral-looking Lombardy
poplars, which to us boys had a sort
of mystic and undefined significance. Here
we procured bits of serpentine, interspersed
with veins of <i>rag-stone</i>, as we denominated
asbestos, which, strangely enough, we used
to chew. I suppose that no boy ever went
to that place alone, and a sort of solemn
ceremony attended his first visit with his
older playmates, to a scene bearing an appellation
ominous enough to call up every
vague dread of his youthful heart. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
approach on these occasions was rather
circuitous, through the pastures, until an
elevated mass of stone, standing quite solitary,
was reached, designated as &#8220;Pulpit
Rock.&#8221; To the summit of this, the neophyte
was required to climb, and there to
repeat some accustomed formula, I fear not
very reverent, by way of initiation, and supposed
to be of power to avert any malign
influences to which the unprepared intruder
upon the premises of the nominal
lord of the domain might otherwise be subjected.
For these youngsters the ordinary
means of education were abundantly supplied,
and the girls, too, had their Academy
for those who aspired to something beyond
the common range; and when, at a later
period, I became conversant with their circle,
I must say that I have never known
young ladies of better manners or more
cultivated minds. As an evidence of more
expansive benevolence than usual, and of
profounder interest in the affairs of the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
world abroad, I remember that when the
<a id='LN_hysterical_girl' name='LN_hysterical_girl'></a>
class of students in Goldsmith&#8217;s Ancient
History came to recitation, one young lady
burst into a torrent of tears. The astonished
teacher anxiously inquired into the
cause of her emotion. In the midst of
her sobs she ejaculated, &#8220;Oh, that good
man, Socrates! To think they should have
treated him so!&#8221; She was finally soothed;
but considering that the incident in question
was of a rather remote date, this ebullition
of feeling evinced a generous sympathy
with a victim of past injustice, truly
worthy of a philanthropic mind.
</p>
<p>
It is still a town of stately mansions upon
its principal street, and one more beautiful
can scarcely be imagined. The magnificent
elms, of the graceful American kind,
which line its borders, have always been
reckoned a feature of extraordinary beauty.
Of late years, special means for supplying
and preserving this elegant and useful kind
of embellishment of the streets have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
provided by the liberal bequest, for this
purpose, of Mr. John Bromfield, a native of
the town, but long a respected merchant at
the capital of the State. A conspicuous
house standing upon a gentle elevation, at
some distance from the street, with pleasant
grounds in its front and rear, was
appropriately named by its original proprietor
&#8220;Mount Rural,&#8221; though not, perhaps,
with the most exact observance of the
requirements of grammatical construction.
Still, it has some authority for being considered
idiomatic, for does not &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress&#8221; tell us of the &#8220;Palace Beautiful?&#8221;
And doubtless many other instances might
be cited of the substitution of an adjective
for a noun. At all events, the worthy
owner, who built his house in the most
approved style of former New England architecture,
spacious, square, and with projecting
windows in the roof, made some
pretensions to classical allusion; for cultivating
extensive gardens in the rear of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
dwelling, he placed for an inscription on his
front wall,&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>
<tr><td><p>&#8220;Miraturque novas frondes, et non sua poma,&#8221;&mdash;
</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
a citation which, it is to be feared, would
be taken rather as encouragement to mischievous
urchins, if any of them understood
it, rather than as a warning to abstain from
the fruit.
</p>
<p>
Near the extremity of the opposite quarter
of the town still stands an ancient edifice
of solid stone, with a couple of stories
of porch of the same material, approached
by a lane, bordered with trees, leading
some distance from the highway, and constituting,
with some modern additions, the
dwelling-place of a considerable farm. It
boasts an age of more than two centuries, as
appears by the figures above its entrance,
and was apparently built for defence, when
precautions against Indian incursions were
thought necessary, though afterwards used
as a powder-house; and tradition has it
that, on one occasion, an explosion took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
place by night, which blew away a part of
the side wall, lifted the bed on which a negro
woman, the slave of the occupant, was
asleep, bore her safely across the road, and
planted her, bed and all, upon the spreading
branches of an apple-tree, without injury.
An early owner of the place was the
ancestor of one of the recent Presidents of
the United States, and it was known, until
quite a modern period, as the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Pierce</span> Farm.
</p>
<p>
Not many years ago, there still remained
at the corner of a street, between the points
just designated, one of those ancient houses
not common in this country, the second story
resting on heavy beams, which showed themselves
in the outside walls, and the walls of
the long, low dwelling filled in with a coat of
dark plaster braced by wooden cross-pieces,
like those of Shakespeare&#8217;s birthplace at
Stratford. The handsome houses before alluded
to were the residences chiefly of merchants,
or sea-captains, who had retired from
their maritime or commercial occupations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
with a competence, or of prosperous professional
persons.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But a competence in those
frugal days was an insignificant sum in comparison
with the fortunes of our own time,
scarcely approaching the annual income of
the shoddy-masters, who now regulate the
avenues of social and so-called aristocratic
life. Indeed, I was once informed by an
old inhabitant, that the richest person in
the town, near the close of the last century,
was assessed upon only ten thousand dollars&#8217;
worth of personal property. But I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
think there must be some mistake in this
statement, unless the rate of taxation was
exceedingly low; for this same prosperous
merchant devoted twenty times as much
as that reputed capital to certain pious
uses, during his protracted life-time, and
still left forty times as much at his decease.
Doubtless in those better days, the inevitable
&#8220;rates&#8221; (&#8220;death and rates,&#8221; they used
to say, &#8220;were certain&#8221;) were so small as to
press but lightly upon the incomes of individuals
in moderate circumstances, and the
means of getting at the exact measure of a
man&#8217;s worldly &#8220;worth,&#8221; had not reached
their present degree of perfection. Indeed
I may state, upon unquestionable authority,
that, late in the first quarter of the present
century, a highly respected trader of the
town, who lived genteelly and was taxed
upon a supposed capital of eighteen thousand
dollars, waited upon the assessors and
blandly told them, &#8220;Gentlemen, I have
been more than usually prosperous the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
year, and am willing you should tax me
upon an additional thousand.&#8221; Such combined
integrity and disinterestedness was
the theme of universal commendation; but
when the old gentleman went to another
reckoning a few years afterwards, his heirs
had the benefit of an estate nearer one hundred
thousand dollars in value, than the
limited capital which had contributed its
quota to the public burdens. In a word,
I have heard my Aunt Judith say, that in
her youth it was usual for respectable young
women to take service with more thriving
neighbors or friends, for the annual allowance
of their board and a single calico gown,
at four and sixpence a yard,&mdash;as the price
was before mills were established on our
own ground.
</p>
<p>
I cannot help referring more particularly
to some of the families of the town, who
imparted to it a well-founded reputation,
not surpassed, if equaled, by that of any
town or city in the land; for instance, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
were the Lowells, who gave name, afterwards,
to that wonderful city of spindles,
which enjoys as world-wide a standing in
the annals of manufacturing enterprise as
the old-world Manchester of a long-anterior
date, and one of whom, amid the desolate
ruins of Luxor, struck by the hand of
fatal disease, conceived the idea of establishing
that noble Institute which bears his
name, and will convey it to future grateful
generations; a name, too, which has so resounded
in the popular literature of the day.
Then, there were the Jacksons, famous in
mechanics and in two of the learned professions;
Charles Jackson, the erudite and
upright judge, and James Jackson, one of
those skillful and truly benevolent physicians,
whose memory is still in the hearts
of many surviving patients. The Tyngs,
too, resided there, long honorably connected
with colonial history and still represented by
descendants of national repute. Amongst
other remarkable individuals was Jacob
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Perkins, the famous inventor, who at an advanced
age ended his useful career with no
little foreign celebrity in the great city of
the world. I have read lately of his successful
exhibition of his wonderful steam-gun,
in the presence of the Duke of Wellington
and other competent judges of the experiment,
and know not what national prejudice,
perhaps, or other casual reason, prevented
its adoption.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In science, too, we had Master
Nicholas Pike, an ancient magistrate,
whose arithmetic held its ground throughout
the country, until it was superseded by
that of Master Michael Walsh, which received
the high commendation of so capital
a judge, in matters of calculation, as the
old land-surveyor and finally head of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
nation, Washington. Master Walsh was an
Irishman by birth, though &#8220;caught young,&#8221;
as Dr. Johnson remarked, to account for
any distinction acquired by natives of Scotland;
and he displayed much of that impulsive
temperament imputed to the people
of Erin&#8217;s Green Isle. He dressed in the
old style, his gray hair gathered into a
queue, and wearing top-boots to the last.
He was an excellent classical scholar, as
well as mathematician. The pupils he prepared
for college did justice to his instructions,
and some have acquired great eminence
in the several professions and in the
conduct of important national affairs. As
an instance of his patriotic attachment to
his adopted country, upon casually meeting,
late in life, a certain writer of the town,
after a cordial salutation, he added with a
slight dash of the brogue, &#8220;I thank ye for
the Red and the Blue!&#8221; The young person
was a little taken aback, not remembering
the allusion, for a moment, when the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
gentleman repeated emphatically,&mdash;&#8220;The
Red and the Blue, ye know&mdash;Tom Campbell.&#8221;
It was in reference to a couple of
stanzas, addressed to the United States by
that great lyric poet, scarcely equaled in his
day, namely:&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>
<tr><td><p>&#8220;United States! your banner wears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two emblems: one of fame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! the other that it bears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminds us of your shame!</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man&#8217;s liberty in types<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands blazoned by your stars:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what&#8217;s the meaning of your stripes?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They mean your negroes&#8217; scars.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>
To this the American had retorted:&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>
<tr>
<td>
<p style='text-align:center; font-size:smaller'>&#8220;TO THE ENGLISH FLAG.</p>
<p>&#8220;England! whence came each glowing hue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tints yon flag of &#8216;meteor&#8217; light,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;The streaming red, the deeper blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossed with the moonbeam&#8217;s pearly white?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
&#8220;The blood and bruise,&mdash;the <i>blue</i> and <i>red</i>,&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;The <i>white</i>,&mdash;it tells the color fled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From starving Erin&#8217;s pallid cheek!&#8221;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The verses were at first circulated as
above set down. Campbell afterwards altered
the two first lines of the second
stanza into:&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Your standard&#8217;s constellation types<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;White freedom by its stars,&#8221; etc.,&mdash;
</p></td></tr></table>

<p>
impairing it, as some will think, both in
force and in whatever poetical expression
it may have originally had. Poets are apt
to make similar mistakes, frittering away
the first glow of thought and language, in
revision. Has not Tennyson thus injured
&#8220;The ride of the six hundred?&#8221; and did
not Campbell himself half spoil &#8220;Hohenlinden,&#8221;
by taming its phraseology down
into a supposed superfluous accuracy? For
example, he first wrote,&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>
<tr><td><p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis morn, but scarce yon lurid sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can pierce the war-clouds, rolling dun,&#8221; etc.
</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
It occurred to him, or some &#8220;stop-watch
critic&#8221; suggested, that the sun itself was
not actually &#8220;lurid,&#8221; on that celebrated occasion,
and he accordingly changed the expression
to &#8220;level,&#8221; thus signifying a mere
natural phenomenon; and, besides the sacrifice
of a fine poetical expression, forgetting
that the sun must have appeared actually
&#8220;lurid&#8221; through the interposition of
&#8220;the war-clouds, rolling dun.&#8221; Nor is this
the only instance of misapplied fastidiousness
in that splendid and stirring piece.
</p>
<p>
Then, there was the Rev. Dr. Spring,
father of that celebrated clergyman, Dr.
Gardiner Spring, of New York. He had
been a chaplain in the army of the Revolution;
and when I, as a boy, pulled off my
cap to him in the street, I fancied there
was something a little military in his polite
salute in return. The good Doctor held to
what were called Hopkinsian tenets, a special
form of strict orthodoxy; and it was alleged
that, differing from the ordinary practice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
of religious people in the town, and
construing literally the record of the Creation,
&#8220;The evening and the morning were
the first day,&#8221;&mdash;the Saturday evening was
observed with primitive strictness in the
family, while on Sunday evening, after sunset,
the excellent matron assumed her knitting-work,
or attended to whatever secular
occupation she chose. I have often thought,
and it seems likely, that the name of Swett&mdash;that
of one of the most eminent and excellent
physicians of his day, in our community,
and who in fact fell a sacrifice to the
faithful discharge of his professional duty&mdash;was
the same as Schwedt, borne by the
Prince de Schwedt, well known at the court
of Frederick of Prussia (so called) the Great.
The good Doctor examined the throat of a
yellow fever patient, in a vessel lying at
quarantine ground in the river, and inhaling
his infectious breath, went home declaring
he had taken the disease, of which he
shortly died. The efforts and liberality of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
his son, the late Colonel Samuel Swett, in
promoting the establishment of the Public
Library of the town, though himself long a
resident in the capital of the State, will forever
endear his memory to the inhabitants.
The daughter of another distinguished physician,
Dr. Sawyer, was Mrs. George Lee,
who gained no little reputation by her
&#8220;Lives of the Ancient Painters,&#8221; and especially
by a book which attained great popularity
under the title of &#8220;Three Experiments
of Living.&#8221; I should do great injustice to a
list of noted personages&mdash;to some of whom
allusion is made elsewhere in these pages,
and which might be extended, if consistent
with the objects of this work, were I to omit
mention of a lady, Miss Hannah F. Gould,
whose poetical productions gained her well-deserved
applause and many friends, and
some of whose highly pleasing verses still
retain their hold upon public esteem. Reflectively,
too, we might claim some share in
the distinction of the most popular American
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
poet of our own day; for the direct ancestors
of Longfellow were natives of our
immediate vicinage. I had no intention,
certainly, of offering any tribute to the living
in these memorials of the past; but
one name inevitably suggests itself, better
known on &#8217;Change, in London, than in
the place of his birth. I speak of William
Wheelwright, a lad, at the period to which
these sketches refer, long resident abroad,
though occasionally brought home by the
obligations and affections of family ties,
to whose enterprise, and arduous, untiring
pursuit of his object are owing steam navigation
and railway lines in the southern
part of this Continent, and to whose praise
the whole South American coast will respond.
</p>
<p>
There were others and many, of high
personal character and local reputation,
and not a few of strongly marked characteristics,
whose names, perhaps, would
scarcely sound familiar to modern ears;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
but I cannot pass over one wealthy merchant,
distinguished for his strong common
sense and decided individuality, as well as
for a success in business scarcely equaled in
this country, in his day,&mdash;the well-known
William Bartlett, to whose judicious bounty
the chief theological seminary of the State
and its principal Academy for the instruction
of youth owe so much toward the assurance
of their permanent foundation.
</p>
<p>
Nor should the memory of Oliver Putnam
fail of a record, who, long absent from
his native town, provided by his will for
a generous bequest, upon which a Free
School of the highest character has been
long established. Nor should due tribute
be forgotten in honor of George Peabody,
who, remembering those days of his youth
which were passed in acquiring habits of
business in the place, distinguished its Public
Library by a munificent gift.
</p>
<p>
There had been many other men of
marked character and great local influence:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
Tracys, Daltons, Greenleafs, Davenports,
Hoopers, Bradburys, Johnsons, Coffins,
Bromfields, Crosses; and many more,
doubtless, might be thought worthy of mention.
Among those named above, Nathaniel
Tracy was one of the wealthiest merchants
of his day, elsewhere referred to in this narrative
as suffering immense losses by his
advances to the government, when its needs
were great and its credit was low, and in
other ways. Tristram Dalton was a Senator
of the United States from Massachusetts, in
the First Congress under the Constitution;
and Theophilus Bradbury, afterwards appointed
to the bench of the supreme court
of the State, was a member of the Federal
House of Representatives during a part of
Washington&#8217;s administration. Indeed, from
some of the early inhabitants of the town
are descended not a few of the principal
families in the capital of the State; and its
representatives, by some tie of original or
later connection, are scattered throughout
the whole country.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
I linger somewhat longer and lovingly
upon this preliminary part of whatever
story I may have to tell, because I am
aware of nothing in the literature of New
England which furnishes precisely similar
reminiscences, and because pictures of past
manners, if truthfully portrayed, can hardly
fail to be both interesting and useful. We
heard plentiful stories, in our youth, of a
higher style of living in colonial days, of
coaches kept by the upper class of citizens;
of their slaves, whom we knew in their
emancipated condition as gardeners and
waiters in general; of the cocked hats, the
gold-embroidered garments, the laced ruffles
of the gentlemen, and the highly ornamented,
but rather stiff garniture in which
the ladies with their powdered heads saw
fit to array themselves, as they now present
themselves to us on the living canvas of
Copley. It was in the handsome residence
of Mr. Dalton, long after his decease, that I
saw hangings of gilded morocco leather on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
the walls of the principal room,&mdash;a substitute
for the wall-paper in common use, and
which I have never seen or heard of in any
other instance, in the United States.
</p>
<p>
Our collector of the customs was peculiarly
one of this class of gentlemen of the
old school. He was a person of very warm
temperament and of remarkable characteristics;
an ardent Democrat, who, upon the
accession of President Jefferson, had succeeded
Colonel W&mdash;&mdash;, the first collector
of the port, appointed by Washington, under
whom he had served with distinction in the
Revolutionary War. The residence of the
latter, and the office of customs itself, in
those simpler days, were in the house which
was afterwards the birthplace of the writer
of these sketches. To that war the successor
of the old soldier principally owed a
large fortune, which he had accumulated as
the result of his privateering adventures;
and it is said that the prizes came in so
plentifully, that once he lifted up his hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
and declared, &#8220;O Lord, it is enough!&#8221;
However this may be, it is certain that not
long afterwards his riches gradually vanished,
and he was compelled to seek and obtained
the office upon which he supported
his declining days. Though &#8220;aristocratic&#8221;
enough in his own personal character and
demeanor, he was not naturally in much
favor with the grandees of the old Federal
town; but they stood in awe of him, nevertheless;
for he had been very rich, and in
his less prosperous days was still a person
of the most impulsive and resolute spirit.
His appearance in public was very marked.
His person was manly and his countenance
singularly striking. He dressed in black,
his small-clothes terminating in white cotton
stockings down to his gouty foot. On
his white head, decorated with a queue, was
his three-cornered hat. He seemed to take
a pride in walking up the principal business
street of the town, at the time of high
&#8220;&#8217;Change,&#8221; and paying attention to no one,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
to utter his not always very conciliatory
thoughts aloud, in regard to his contemporaries
and matters in general, as he threw
out sideways the gouty foot aforesaid, on
his way to the one o&#8217;clock dinner, which
was the fashion of the time.
</p>
<p>
But the Revolutionary War exhausted
the fortunes of many prosperous men of
the day; and the story is told of one very
rich merchant, who could drive in his own
carriage several days&#8217; journey&mdash;when such
a journey over difficult roads was hardly so
much as could be accomplished by &#8220;the hollow,
pampered jades of Asia,&#8221;&mdash;and sleep
in his own house every night. He lent
immense sums, for the time, to the Revolutionary
government, received what he could
recover in depreciated currency, and failed.
At the period of my narrative, the country
was suffering from the consequences of
another war, and the once active commerce
of the old town was reduced to the lowest
ebb. It was then that active emigration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
began from the sterile soil of New England&mdash;since
rendered so much more productive
by intelligent cultivation&mdash;to the fertile
region known as &#8220;The Ohio;&#8221; just as, not
much more than half a century ago, people
talked of &#8220;The Coos country&#8221; in New
Hampshire, and within a few years we
spoke of the &#8220;Far West,&#8221; brought at length
within the compass of ordinary travel and
civilization.
</p>
<p>
As a picture of the rigors and extremities,
I fear only too common, of early New
England life, among its hardy agricultural
population, I present extracts of a letter received
from a venerable friend, a few years
ago, who from the depths of poverty, having
emigrated in his youth to wild lands
not very far West, had risen to comparative
wealth, which he devoted to useful purposes.
In fact, the son of an extremely
poor Vermont farmer became, by his own
energy and integrity, the possessor of a
competent fortune, which enabled him, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
views far surpassing the immediate claims
of this transitory world, to build a church
and to establish a flourishing educational
institution, destined long, I trust, to dispense
infinite blessings to future generations.
Thus, after some preliminary matter,
he proceeds to say, under date of
March 16, 1866:&mdash;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
&#8220;My father was one of the poor men of Vermont.
When I was a small boy I have pealed
many a birch broom for a sixpence.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> My Father
could get one shilling for what he made,
take them on his back, carry them four or five
miles, sell them, bring home a little meal, or a
little bread, sometimes a half bushel Potatoes.
My mother would go two or three miles, and do
a washing, bring home at night a loaf of wry
bread, and a small peace was all we had for
supper and a smaller Piece in the morning.

My mother has stirred butter in a tea-cup with
the point of a knife, to keep her little children
from starving. My Father had about half acre
of oats&mdash;poor fence&mdash;the old cow got in the
oats and died. Then came the pinch&mdash;we as
little children had to flee to the woods to get
something to sustain life&mdash;no schools, no
meetings&mdash;nothing but hunger and despair.
I lived with my Father until I was twenty-one
years old. After I was sixteen my Father improved
a little in living. When I was a little
over twenty-one I got me a wife&mdash;we was both
Poor&mdash;three knifes, three forks, three teacups,
three chairs, a poor bed&mdash;hardly could we
keep house. But our courage was good&mdash;my
wife always standing by me, through all my
trouble and trials&mdash;shoulder to shoulder&mdash;heart
&amp; hand, from the day of our marriage
until the day of her Death. No man never had
a better wife than I had&mdash;always kind to the
Poor and to all her relations. She is now in
the Grave Yard, and my judgment is, she is well
prepared for the next world&mdash;and for the good
feeling I have had for her for over fifty-six

years, I have Erected a monument over her
grave weighing 7 tons, and twenty-one feet
high&mdash;it is a splendid monument&mdash;cost me
over $600.00.

There is, perhaps, a touch of the garrulity
of age in this good man&#8217;s recital; but
I consider his record of his early life, slight
as it is, yet too strikingly suggestive to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
be left to chances which might await a
private letter. Indeed, the character thus
displayed is surely equal to that of the best
of the old Romans, in the middling class
of life, enlightened too by a living faith of
which they had no conception; and the
sketch gives fair warrant for the conclusion,
that, in point of manly simplicity and integrity,
the traits and the trials of those
elder worthies who helped to settle our
republican institutions have not been overdrawn.

The late Mr. George Wood, of Washington, a native
of our town, in some highly interesting <i>Memorabilia</i>,
formerly published, says: &#8220;The aristocracy were not
on High Street, as now, but on Water Street, and more
at the South than the North end, as the old houses give
evidence to this day. The Johnsons, Jacksons, Davenports,
Coffins, Greenleafs, Bartletts, Pierces, Hoopers,
Tappans, Todds, Carters, Lunts, Marquands, and others
of wealth, were on Water Street or near it. There
were their grand houses and fine gardens, and it was
not till they thought of retiring from business that they
removed to the West-end or up-town, as gradually as
they always do in all places.&#8221;

<p>
I should scarcely deem it expedient to
enter at much detail into the eccentricities
of our good townspeople, though it seems
to me that in our own street I could recall
enough to make a pretty sizable volume.
</p>
<p>
But one feature of the times deserves a
passing notice. I refer to the inconsiderable
number of insane persons, compared
with the sad increase of that unfortunate
class in our own day, and the manner in
which they were treated. Of course, a
more widely extended population multiplies
the sum of every description of disease.
Besides, our ancestors were a hardier
race than their descendants, more inured
to the regular routine of physical toil, less
given than the men and women of the present
day to hurtful indulgence, and far less
exposed to the disturbing excitements of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
business and pleasure. So far as I know,
there were but two really insane persons in
our population of some seven or eight thousand,
though doubtless certain others were
more or less &#8220;light-headed.&#8221; One of those
two was sullenly crazy, and accounted dangerous,
and therefore subjected to physical
restraint; the other, generally harmless,
roamed through the town at his own will,
calling occasionally upon the acquaintance
of his better days, and making magnificent
promises of the benefits he intended to
bestow, &#8220;when his ship came in.&#8221; If I had
inherited only a moderate dividend of the
proceeds of the successive ships and their
cargoes, which he promised my mother, on
the above favorable contingency, usually
calling her out from dinner to whisper to
her these magnificent promises, more to
her alarm than satisfaction, though being a
woman of spirit she put a brave face upon
it&mdash;I should look down upon a Rothschild,
an Astor, or a Vanderbilt with natural
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
contempt. Sometimes, incarceration
was thought necessary, also, in his case;
and I have a vivid recollection of the place
of confinement allotted to each patient.
</p>
<p>
This was in the yard of the almshouse,
for state and county asylums had not then
been thought of, and the strong wooden
building in which they were placed consisted
of two apartments, perhaps twelve
feet square, one above and the other beneath
the surface of the ground; the latter,
in fact, a dungeon with one barred window
on a level with the yard. Here they passed
their gloomy hours as they might, in solitude
and darkness, scarcely relieved by
light from without, with nothing to alleviate
the horrors of their condition, and
probably considered in a state too hopeless
to admit of any remedy. The tenant of
the upper cell was comparatively lively, on
the occasion of resort to his window for
conversation, or out of curiosity, which was
freely permitted; but his neighbor in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
dungeon was dangerous; and I can never
forget the terror inspired by a sudden and
vicious attempt made by him to seize the
legs of us children through the bars, as we
stood conversing with the inmate of the
room above. Science and humanity have
done very much, in modern times, toward
the restoration of such unhappy beings,
who are in a majority of cases susceptible
of cure, or of improvement enough to warrant
their return to domestic life. But it
is to be feared we are yet far behind, in
this country, the more enlightened and
effectual methods pursued for this purpose
in some other civilized nations.
</p>
<p>
On one side of the street above alluded
to lived for a long time, in my boyhood, an
ancient shoemaker entirely alone; and as
he guarded his residence with great secrecy
and sold none of his wares, curious
people were puzzled to understand how he
supported existence. He was known to
be partially deranged. Mischievous boys,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
sometimes, gathered in numbers, would
often assail his door with stones, standing
ready for a start. But if they were on the
watch, so was Pettengill, from previous experience,
waiting behind his door with a
heavy wooden bar in his hand, and giving
instant chase to the flying urchins, would
send the bar rattling at their heels. One
day, after a season of unusual quiet, one of
our lads anxious to penetrate his mystery,
ventured to knock gently at the barred portal,
was admitted, and expressed his wish
to purchase a pair of shoes. The old man
opened several chests containing the articles
sought for, and finally selected a pair
which proved a fit; but upon his visitor&#8217;s
making known his readiness to buy, the
maker deliberately returned them to their
receptacle, locked it fast and gravely declared,
that he did &#8220;not like to part with
them, for fear of spoiling his assortment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The next building was occupied by a
respectable English couple as a dwelling-place,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
with a small grocer&#8217;s shop in front.
They had no children, except one strapping
son of the old lady by a former husband,
grown to man&#8217;s estate, and whose business
seemed to be to lounge about the premises
in drab small-clothes; for I never saw him
do anything. The old lady might be seen
of a morning, with iron pattens on her feet
and her clothes tucked up, mopping the
floor of the shop; but in the afternoon much
more genteelly attired in silks of an ancient
fashion. Mr. Brown was a very quiet, inoffensive
person, the wife a little high-strung.
It is certain that they had occasional domestic
bickerings, perhaps about the young
man in the knee-breeches; for on one occasion
it is alleged that the old matron was
overheard to address her spouse, with a
slightly Hibernian accentuation,&mdash;&#8220;Brune,
Brune, ye case-knife looking son of a gun!
I married ye neither for love, nor for
money, but the pure convanience of the
shop!&#8221; As these worthy people have long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
ago passed away, there seems no scandal
in detailing this little family incident.
</p>
<p>
Directly opposite these premises was a
large old-fashioned house, still standing,
and, a century before, the residence of the
minister of the First Church. It was long
afterwards occupied by a noted magistrate
for the trial of small actions, who served
many years as town-clerk, and was an energetic
orator at town-meetings and in parish
affairs. A culprit was once brought
before him for stealing a gentleman&#8217;s set
of new shirts. The fact was stiffly denied.
&#8220;A pretty story,&#8221; said the accused party,
&#8220;that I should take his shirts!&#8221; An official
scrutiny, however, soon exhibited him
standing with the half dozen articles of
attire, one over another, upon his person.
&#8220;What a villain!&#8221; said the astonished justice.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me you was a
villain and save the time of the court, of the
witnesses, and the spectators, by owning up
you were a villain, in the first place?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
The citizens of the old town were pretty
thorough Puritans, by inheritance and inclination,
at the middle of the last century.
But the minister of the First Church was,
in his day, a gentleman noted for his liberal
tastes and accomplishments. He had
a picture painted on a broad panel over
the fire-place of his library, representing
himself and several others of the cloth sitting
around a table, in the full canonicals
of wig, gown, and band, before each a
foaming mug of ale, and each supplied with
a tobacco pipe from which rolled volumes
of narcotic fumes. At the top of the painting
was a legend in the Latin language, of
which the following is, I believe, a correct
copy,&mdash;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
&#8220;In essentialibus unitas, in non-essentialibus libertas, in omnibus charitas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
They appeared to be having a jolly time,
and evidently considered the slight indulgences
to which they were addicted among
the moral non-essentials, however necessary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
to their physical comfort. In this picture,
which is still extant, the rules of
perspective were not rigorously obeyed.
In fact, the table is considerably tipped,
whether supposed to result from some sudden
hilarious movement on the part of the
reverend compotators or owing to want of
skill in the artist, I am not able to testify.
Indeed, the manners of the times had not
then attained their present professed strictness
in regard to the use of exhilarating
liquors, and I have inspected a tavern-bill
rendered to the principal citizens, for articles
of this sort consumed on some joyful
public occasion, at a much later period, the
amount of which in quantity, though not
in price, would astonish a modern city
council.
</p>
<p>
At the corner of the street stood an
ancient tavern, the principal establishment
of the kind in the place, at which in staging
times all the stage-coaches from Boston
and the eastward hauled up to change
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
horses. It was kept by the father of the
popular host of one of the best known of
the long-established New York hotels. I
well remember seeing a considerable body
of British sailors halted there for refreshment,
under guard, on their way to some
prison in the interior, during the War of
1812. They were true British tars of the
traditional type, with immense clubs of
hair, tied up with eel-skins and hanging
short and thick down their necks. They
seemed in no wise depressed by their condition
and in fact were treated extremely
well, for the general feeling of the town
was decidedly adverse to the war. I also
remember a gathering in front of the tavern,
when the evening coach was expected,
with the idea of mobbing an unpopular
general officer who was to pass through by
that conveyance. But a better sentiment
was inculcated by the more orderly portion
of the assembly, and the obnoxious warrior
was not molested, otherwise than by expressions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
of dislike, either upon alighting,
or when taking his place to resume his
journey. Politics ran very high at the
time, almost to the entire suspension of
social relations between the differing parties,&mdash;the
Federalists, who opposed the
war, and were accused of unpatriotic sympathy
with the cause of the enemy, and
the Republicans, often stigmatized as Jacobins,
who were charged with the principles
and designs which had given impulse to
the great French Revolution. Doubtless
these parties shared, on the one side and
the other, in the hereditary enmity, long
since allayed if not altogether extinguished,
between England and France. But whatever
might be the general turn of political
sentiment, both sides felt a patriotic pride
in the success of the American arms.
Hence, it is probable, the temper of the
crowd assembled to do dishonor to the unlucky
general. While the Republicans were
indignant at a supposed needless national
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
disaster, the Federalists could scarcely rejoice
at it; and thus the moderation of the
latter tended to restrain the former from
the display of any actually violent demonstration.
At the same period, there was
formed, among the older administration
men of the day, a veteran military organization,
of those beyond the ordinary age
of military service, well-known locally under
the significant appellation of the &#8220;Silver
Greys.&#8221; The corps was composed of
elderly merchants and traders and retired
sea-captains, and their drills manifested at
least the ambition of military prowess.
Their opponents alleged that their company
was formed for merely political purposes,
and to overawe the town; but their
own doubtless more just solution of the
matter was, that their object was to aid in
repelling invasion, in the unlikely case that
the British troops should land upon their
own borders. They gave more promise,
certainly, of efficient service, should danger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
arise, than could be expected of the superannuated
Trojans chief of Priam&#8217;s court,
as their catalogue is translated by Pope
from the living record of Homer:&mdash;

The town had suffered everything from
the war and the interdiction of commerce
in which it had been most actively engaged,
preceding the event. Multitudes
were absolutely ruined, and the gaunt wolf
stood grinning at almost every other threshold.
Among the memorials of that great
struggle, it may be as well to mention the
rusted cannon planted for posts at the corners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
of certain of the streets, the breech
sunk in the ground and a bomb-shell fastened
in the muzzle. At such a time, it is
not strange that force occasionally took the
place of law.
</p>
<p>
I could recall not a few instances in
which, under the impulse of political resentment,
passion got the better of judgment.
One day, the marshal of the United
States, in his cocked hat and with other
official insignia, entered the tavern I have
mentioned, in quest of a fugitive from justice.
He inquired of a person whom he
met in the public apartment, if he had
lately seen one Captain E&mdash;&mdash;, who, it
seems, on some supposed provocation, had
only thrown a custom-house officer into the
dock in one of our eastern harbors. The
person addressed by the marshal said that
Captain E&mdash;&mdash; had just passed down the
street, and when the marshal turned to
pursue the culprit, that individual, who
was no other than the one just addressed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
slipped out of another door, ran by the
stable in the rear of the tavern and called
upon Jem Knox, the hostler, to harness a
chaise with all speed and to follow him
forthwith in his flight. It appears, that the
story of the captain&#8217;s adventure was already
pretty well known in the public places of
the town, and as a visit of the marshal from
Boston was a very extraordinary event in a
place usually so quiet, a prying character
who was upon the spot asked him if he was
not looking for Captain E&mdash;&mdash;. Upon receiving
an affirmative reply,&mdash;&#8220;That&#8217;s the
man,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have just spoken to.&#8221;
The marshal started in pursuit and the
captain had called out to such persons of
his acquaintance as saw him running, that
he was chased by a United States&#8217; officer.
Half way through the street, one Clement
Starr, a stalwart Englishman, who lived at
the spot and whose sympathies, political
and otherwise, were with the weaker party,
seized the marshal by the collar and insisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
upon knowing what was the cause
of the considerable tumult which the outcry&mdash;&#8220;Stop
him!&#8221; had raised. Escaping
this obstacle, the poor marshal was soon
afterwards clasped in the vigorous embrace
of a spirited matron, who stood on her
door-step as he passed, and, besides being
an acquaintance of the captain, was of the
same political proclivities as those of the
retreating mariner.
</p>
<p>
While tearing himself away from this
lively lady, Knox drove furiously by, pulled
up as he overtook the fugitive, who, as a
witness of the affair told me, tumbled into
the chaise, and was soon out of the reach
of the threatening danger. Whether he
was ever taken afterwards, or what became
of the prosecution, I have never heard.
</p>
<p>
Not far from us lived a worthy widow,
with a family of children, and on one occasion
she was heard to mingle rather curiously
an office of devotion with a somewhat
severe threat of domestic discipline. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
was a day in summer, and the windows
being open, a passer-by heard her objurgation.
It seems the family had assembled at
the dinner-table, and her oldest son began
by making premature demonstrations toward
the provisions, when his mother
emphatically addressed him: &#8220;You Bob
Barker, if you stick your fork into that
meat before I&#8217;ve asked a blessing, I&#8217;ll be
the death of ye!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
There was a worthy shipmaster, also,
who used to trade to Hayti, when that stalwart
colored person, Christophe, was the
Emperor, who used to say, &#8220;Put a bag of
coffee in the mouth of h&mdash;&mdash;, and a Yankee
will be sure to go after it.&#8221; On one occasion,
so the story ran, Captain H&mdash;&mdash; complained
of some insult from one of Christophe&#8217;s
ragged soldiery. The fact reached
the ears of that potentate, who desired to
stand well with Americans, and our townsman
was summoned before him. He found
in the presence of the monarch the whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
body of the scanty force on duty in the
town. &#8220;Can you pick out the man who
insulted you?&#8221; asked the sable autocrat.
Captain H&mdash;&mdash; pointed him out; but beginning
to fear the infliction of some punishment
too severe, attempted to extenuate
the offence. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried Christophe, and
called the soldier near him. &#8220;Do you say
this was the man of whom you have told
me?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, sir, it is,&#8221; replied the alarmed
captain; &#8220;but&#8221;&mdash;In an instant Christophe
had drawn his sword, and with one blow
struck off the head of the unlucky culprit.
The terror of the accusing party, at such
a sudden and bloody consummation, may
be partly imagined. He procured his clearance
as soon as possible, and I believe
made his future voyages to waters under a
less summarily sanguinary domination.
</p>

We had also a <i>soi-disant</i> nobleman, of
really the humblest extraction, and ignorant
to a singular degree, but known by his eccentricities
far and wide, who, on the score
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
of a little money accidentally amassed, proclaimed
himself, by an inscription beneath
a wooden statue of himself, in front of his
residence,&mdash;&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord of the East, Lord
Of the West, and the Greatest Philosopher
in the Western World.</span>&#8221; He
decorated his court-yard with an extraordinary
amount of lumber of this sort, in the
shape of human beings, and dumb creatures
of many sorts, each statue standing upon
its separate pillar, to the intense admiration
of the gaping rustics who visited the
town to inspect it; and he fairly beat the
Scottish Earl of Buchan, who was infected
with a similar mania. Upon an arch directly
opposite his front door, he had placed
Washington, Adams, and Jefferson. Adams,
on the right, was bareheaded, and upon an
inquiry by some one why this distinction
was made, since Jefferson&#8217;s chapeau was in
its place, the great &#8220;lord&#8221; replied: &#8220;Do
you suppose I would have anybody stand
at the right hand of Washington, with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
hat on?&#8221; He was said, also, upon certain
hilarious occasions, celebrated in a tomb
which he had constructed under a summer-house
in his garden, to have indulged in
the mastication of bank-bills between slices
of bread and butter, doubtless to the envy
of his boon companions; not, as might be
inferred, of the better or richer classes,
though, considering all things, it is perhaps
needless to hope that these current symbols
of value were a little cleaner than
most of those of modern date. All this
statuary rubbish, however, was long ago
removed; and the house and grounds, by
the taste of the present owner, have since
ranked among the most pleasing objects
of inspection in the town.
</p>
<p>
This notably low and singularly eccentric
character, as I have remarked, fairly beat
that other oddity,&mdash;in a different class of
life and contemporary with him,&mdash;the Scottish
Earl of Buchan, elder half-brother of
Lord Chancellor Erskine. That nobleman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
was possessed with a passion for the busts
of persons, eminent or otherwise, not dissimilar
to that of our New England &#8220;lord&#8221; for
wooden statuary, and perhaps was actuated
by equal vanity, though a person of real
literary accomplishment, and in no sense,
except as mentioned, to be put in comparison
with the other. He displayed to his
visitors a large and most incongruous collection
of these objects of art in a sort of
grotto excavated in his garden, thus reversing,
however, the more conspicuous procedure
of his brother connoisseur, who exhibited
his assemblage of rarities in his
front yard. The Scottish Earl, certainly,
had some literary pretensions, while the
&#8220;lord&#8221; Timothy, who could neither read
nor write with ordinary expertness, honored
the Muses, also, by affording countenance
to a poet. Whether this patronage
extended to much material sustenance may
be considered doubtful, since this son of
Apollo generally stood in the market-place,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
when not wandering away to other
parts, for the disposal of his wares, dressed
in semi-clerical habiliments, himself being
of a singularly grave aspect, and retailed
frightful ballads of his own composition,
and small wares of various kinds from a
basket on his arm. It is questionable
whether any of these literary productions
survive to the present day; and I fear that
not one of them had any spark of that vitality,
potent to influence popular sentiment,
which Fletcher of Saltoun attributed to the
songs of the people.
</p>
<p>
In the centre of this market-place&mdash;a
space inclosed on all sides by various
shops or stores, and for some unaccountable
reason styled &#8220;Market Square,&#8221; since
its irregular outline much more resembled a
truncated triangle&mdash;stood the town pump,
on the spot originally occupied by the
meeting-house of the First Church, already
mentioned. On two sides of the pump
were set the wonted hand-carts of two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
superannuated individuals, whose gingerbread,
candies, and apples were the delight
of such urchins as were lucky enough to
have coppers to buy with; for those convenient
mediums of exchange were not too
plentiful among boys in 18&mdash;, and frequently
not with their parents either. These
old men were the undisturbed possessors
of the ground, wheeling their vehicles to
the spot at early morning, and standing
by them all day, though they never seemed
to me to be driving a very thriving business.
</p>
<p>
But the glory of the Square was during
the week before Thanksgiving,&mdash;then, as
now, appointed for a day late in November,
when it was often difficult to make one&#8217;s
way through the throng of teams, and especially
sleighs, loaded with poultry fattened
for the occasion, and sometimes venison
and abundance of other commodities
for domestic use. The mention of sleighs
leads me to recur to a former remark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
upon the earlier approach of winter in
those times; for the employment of sleighs
implies the presence of snow upon the
ground; and the farmers had frequently
driven from a great distance, &#8220;up country,&#8221;
from parts of New Hampshire and Vermont,
even from the borders of Canada,
perhaps a hundred and fifty or two hundred
miles and more away, to attend the
market in our town; sometimes as many
as a hundred loaded country sleighs, or on
other occasions as many wagons, in a single
day. The construction of the Middlesex
Canal, connecting the waters of the Merrimack
with those of the Charles, diverted
the main part of this traffic to Boston; and
railways finally conveyed to the capital
most of the remainder which came from
any considerable distance. Wistful eyes,
in the presence of these heaping dainties,
were sometimes averted, no doubt, from a
consciousness of empty pockets; yet there
were always generous hearts and bounteous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
hands to meet the exigencies of every
neighborhood; and we may be sure that no
householder of decent repute, however poor
or unlucky, and probably few others, even
if a little tarnished in the moral world&#8217;s
esteem, lacked some kind friend who saw
to it, that the accustomed turkey or chickens
smoked on the board before the eyes
of his hungry children on that day, at least,
of all the year.
</p>
<p>
But, unless respectable legends are to
be peremptorily discredited, an incident
once took place in this Market Square, of
which I doubt if any other New England
town can show the parallel. I am about
to relate a statement made to me, not
many years ago, by an elderly gentleman
of excellent character and standing, a justice
of the peace and of the quorum, and a
devout member of the Orthodox Church.
The story was told with all gravity and
implicit confidence in its truth; and some
may think it exhibits in a striking light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the extent of human credulity and the
imperfection of human testimony: &#8220;My
father,&#8221; said this worthy person, &#8220;has
often told me of being in Market Square
when a man, a woman, and a little dog
appeared, and soon collected quite a crowd
by the exhibition of feats of jugglery. At
length, after a due collection of tribute from
the standers-by, the man produced a ball
of cord from his pocket, threw it into the
air, and began to ascend it, hand over hand.
The woman followed, and after her the little
dog. While the crowd was gaping, in
expectation of the return of this mysterious
trio, some one drove into the market-place
and inquired the occasion of this unusual
congregation. Upon being informed, he
said, that he had just met such a party on
the road, about a mile from the town.&#8221; I
had read the most extraordinary accounts,
by British officers and others, of exhibitions
like this, which they alleged they had often
witnessed in India. I remembered one, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
particular, where tigers and other unwelcome
guests, and even the somewhat unwieldy
bulk of an elephant, had seemingly
been brought down, before their eyes,
upon a cable fastened by some mysterious
agency far aloft; for I suppose it behooved
to be made fast in some inconceivable region
of the upper air. But that a similar
demonstration could have been made in
a sober New England town, at noonday,
could scarcely fail to &#8220;put me from my
faith.&#8221; It impressed me, however, as at least
an extraordinary relation, coming from such
a source; and happening to meet another
ancient and equally reputable friend on
the same day, one, too, who had been much
about the world in the capacity of a navigator
to foreign climes, I took occasion to
relate to him the strange narrative which
I had just heard. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there is
no doubt about it; my mother has often
told me she was present and saw the whole
transaction.&#8221; &#8220;In the mouth of two or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
three witnesses,&#8221; says the Scripture, &#8220;shall
every word be established.&#8221; In this case,
it will be observed, the witnesses were
two, but both at second-hand. I shall not
vouch, therefore, for anything except that,
as Scott says, &#8220;I tell the tale as &#8217;twas told
to me,&#8221;&mdash;and it may be set down as one of
these veritable legends which all persons
are at liberty to reject or accept, as they
please. I expect to try the faith of the
reader still further before I have finished
this historical sketch. People often tell us,
nowadays, that vulgar superstitions are altogether
things of the past. This may be
so in public; but I imagine that in private
there is a lurking tinge of it in every human
bosom.

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p>
In maritime towns, at a season of the
year when there is no inducement for them
to wander into the fields, boys who have
nothing else to do, on play-days, are very
apt to lounge, more or less, on the wharves
and in the Market Place. When quite a
youngster, I witnessed a scene on the spot
last named, the incidents of which are as
vivid in my memory as at the moment
when they occurred, more than half a century
ago. Though the commerce of our
town had very materially declined from its
former condition of wonderful activity and
enterprise, it was still kept up with considerable
semblance of its former spirit,
and, besides our native vessels, a foreign
ship occasionally sailed up our beautiful
river. A few miles beyond the stream, in
the neighboring State, dwelt a population
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
chiefly agricultural, a portion of which,
pursuing the avocation of small farmers
and fishermen, alternately, for they were
directly on the borders of the sea and
somewhat isolated in their position, besides,
were certainly a little wild in character
and habits; though I am told that
great improvement among them, in these
respects, has taken place of later years.
We called them &#8220;Algerines,&#8221; from which
epithet, more opprobrious than probably
just, our estimate of their pretensions to
civilization may be inferred. It was the
practice of these people to bring their fish
in whale-boats to our market, which was
the nearest to their homes, and to dispose
of this fruit of their often perilous labors
either for money, or for such commodities
as they required. I was standing, one afternoon,
near a group of foreign sailors,
believed to be Spaniards, with the natural
curiosity of a boy, and rough-looking specimens
of humanity they certainly were. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
seemed that they had fallen into dispute
with the crew, some three or four men, of
an Algerine boat, and though the language
on one side and the other was altogether
unintelligible to the parties, the tones were
uncommonly high. Doubtless, the Spaniards
were resenting some insult offered by
the Algerines,&mdash;prompted by that sort of
jealousy and dislike with which the lower
classes of English blood have been in the
habit of regarding those of other nationalities.
The quarrel seemed especially at its
height between one of the Spanish crew
and a young man of remarkable stature
in coarse seaman&#8217;s dress, with a great bush
of long yellow locks hanging over the collar
of his jacket, whose name it appeared
was Souter. The Spanish champion had
drawn an ugly looking knife, from which
unfamiliar weapon, flourished so near his
person, the Algerine instinctively flinched.
At this critical moment, the patriarch of
the Yankee crew, a tall, gaunt old man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
with grizzled hair, stepped into the arena,
and, seizing the foreigner by the collar,
cried out,&mdash;&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll bet Tom Souter&#8221;
(pronounced Saouter) &#8220;could take this &#8217;ere
fellow right here by the collar and shake
every g&mdash;&mdash; right aout of him,&#8221;&mdash;using a
more vulgar phrase, and suiting the action
to the word so vigorously that the reeling
and astounded Spaniard was glad enough to
relinquish the field and to slink away crestfallen
with his companions.
</p>
<p>
As a further illustration of the ways of
our neighbors, I will give one more anecdote
of an affair which occurred years afterwards.
Not far from the hamlet of our
friends, the Algerines, but within the borders
of Massachusetts, was another settlement,
on the outskirts of a thriving village,
the male inhabitants of which also followed
the calling of small farmers and fishermen,
some of them diversifying these pursuits
by the occupation of shoemaking, at the
ungenial season of the year. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
industrious, and far less rude than their
compatriots, to whom reference has just
been made. At this point lived three
young men, hard by each other, and brothers,
of the name, I will say, of Lowe. One
day a tall and respectable looking old gentleman
called upon the writer of this history,
announcing himself as Colonel Lowe,
and the father of the three young men in
question. He had formerly commanded, it
seems, a regiment of militia, and had a sort
of semi-military bearing. He was now in
great agitation and distress, occasioned by
some trouble in which his sons were involved,
through forcible resistance to the
civil authorities of the Commonwealth, and
he required the professional services of
the writer for their defence. He justly
regarded it as a case likely to lead to
very serious consequences, and particularly
dreaded for the young men the disgraceful
punishment of the State Prison. It was a
case to elicit every degree of sympathy for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
the worthy Colonel, and to prompt every
effort for his relief. The facts, as they
appeared at the trial before the Court of
Common Pleas, were quite picturesque. A
constable had appeared with an execution
against one of the young Lowes, in the
matter of a claim which he disputed as unjust;
but without giving the peace-officer
opportunity to discharge his duty, he was
driven from the ground by the trio, in
mortal terror of his life. The execution
of the process was then undertaken by a
somewhat fantastic country deputy sheriff;
who was ordered off as he attempted to
approach the parties in defence, and between
them and the officer there was a
good deal of raillery, which had an important
bearing upon the final result of the
trial. At length, the elder brother Lowe
drew a line with a stick across the road
and defied the officer to pass it, which he
declined to do, but at once made good his
retreat, smothering his indignation at such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
a rebuff, until he could give it vent in
more safety than the existing circumstances
warranted. Such reckless conduct
was not to be endured, and no doubt the
deputy was laughed at by his neighbors
for his failure to carry his purpose into
effect. The majesty of the Commonwealth
had been insulted in his official person, and
he determined to summon a <i>posse comitatus</i>,
to vindicate the power and dignity of the
law. Stories in the country, especially
those involving any extraordinary incidents,
sometimes fly faster than in town, and accordingly
these young rebels forewarned,
no doubt, of the peril in prospect, prepared
themselves, as well as they could, to resist
the more formidable invasion presently to
be expected. Before daylight, one morning,
the mustered force of some twenty men,
variously armed, led by the valiant sheriff&#8217;s
officer, cautiously drew near the premises,
in the hope of catching the culprits asleep.
The brothers were too quick for their visitors,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
however, and evidently having been
on the watch had retreated to a barn, securely
fastening the door, and awaited the
approach of the enemy. They had with
them certain weapons, which were exhibited
in the court, consisting of ancient rusty
halberds and spontoons, probably borne in
turn by their gallant father, in his several
gradations of military service. As they
were summoned to surrender, a musket was
discharged out of a window of the barn,
over the heads of the assailants, occasioning
considerable confusion in their line. Assuming
courage, at length, axes and crowbars
were brought into requisition, and the
door was forced. As the attacking party
entered, however, the Lowes let down the
stairs leading to the story above a heavy
broad cart-wheel, and as it bounded clattering
towards the floor below, the assailants
fled out of doors in a panic, and taking
advantage of their disorder, the Lowes,
disregarding the vast disproportion of numbers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
rushed upon them, and a regular
mêleé began. It is thought, that the
smaller party would have been victorious,
but for an ugly blow on the head of the
youngest brother, which felled and disabled
him; whereupon his associates escaped
unmolested and he was taken helpless
into the house, where he remained
until the time of the trial. Of course, the
jury found him guilty, for the facts of the
case were patent; but it was taken up, by
exceptions to the ruling of the Judge, into
the Supreme Court, in which, though it
would be irreverent to intimate that the
justices entered at all into the humor of
such a Donnybrook Fair sort of scrimmage,
yet, after argument, and it is presumed
in consideration of some provocation
on the part of the sheriff&#8217;s deputy,
especially the needlessly warlike and really
ridiculous aspect he impressed on the affair,
leading the young men to look upon it
rather as an invitation to play their part,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
than as a serious purpose to violate the
law, the sentence imposed was only a few
months&#8217; imprisonment in the common jail.
The prosecution was never enforced against
the brothers, and never was more lively
gratitude displayed, than at the escape of
the convicted culprit from sentence to the
ignominious seclusion of the State Prison.

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p>
A term of the Court of Common Pleas
was always held in the town in the month
of September, and &#8220;court week&#8221; was a
regular time of holiday for the pupils of
the higher schools. Some of us attended
upon these solemn proceedings with extraordinary
interest, especially when criminal
cases were before the court. I know
not how it is, but suppose it to be the expected
revelation of incidents, as in the plot
of a novel, which draws crowds together, in
most uncomfortable contiguity in a courtroom,
whenever a culprit, especially one of
more than usually notorious antecedents, is
put upon his trial. While most of the old-fashioned
lawyers of the Essex Bar were
more than respectable for professional acquisitions
and legal skill, there were persons
among them of distinguished ability
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
and character; and real eloquence seldom
fails to prove peculiarly fascinating to
youthful hearers. Who could forget, for
example, with what rapt attention he listened,
at a somewhat later date, to the
glowing language and was stirred by the
honest warmth of Saltonstall, incapable by
nature of attempting to make the worse
appear the better reason; or watched that
marvel, the matchless ingenuity of Choate,
whose faculties shone brightest, the more
apparently hopeless was the cause at stake;
or thrilled with profound admiration, under
the resistless influence of Webster&#8217;s force
and closeness of argument, rising, with due
occasion, to the highest point of eloquent
illustration, when some more than usually
important matter for adjudication by the
court called him from the ordinary sphere
of his great practice to the forum of a
comparatively inferior tribunal.
</p>
<p>
Years afterwards, when I had the honor
of a place at that Bar, I was much struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
with the testimony of a respectable witness,
a farmer named Sheldon, who lived near
Beverly Corner, upon an indictment of a
fellow for burglary, in entering Mr. Sheldon&#8217;s
house by night and taking the money
from his pockets in his sleeping chamber
without disturbing the occupants. One of
the earliest questions proposed to him was,&mdash;&#8220;How
did the robber gain entrance to
the house?&#8221; and, by the way, the man had
been previously employed as a laborer by
the farmer. &#8220;I suppose he came in by the
usual way,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;He came
in by the door, do you mean?&#8221; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;How did he get it open?&#8221; &#8220;I suppose
he lifted the latch.&#8221; &#8220;Do you mean to
say, that the door was not fastened?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes I do; we never fasten it.&#8221; The culprit
was convicted upon various satisfactory
testimony; but the incident betokens a
state of security, at that period, and a
rarity of flagitious offences, which puts to
shame the demoralization of our own day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
For the house in question stood on the
high road and was scarcely more than half
a mile distant from a populous neighborhood,
and within less than three miles of
a town with many thousands of inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
Strangely enough, considering the want
of precaution on the part of the farmer,
coming down, doubtless, from a still simpler
period of social life, not half a mile
from Mr. Sheldon&#8217;s house stood a solitary
habitation upon a desolate tract of land,
and also near the highway, which at a
time not long subsequent had acquired a
very evil reputation; and with this house
became connected circumstances which
some may think scarcely admit of the
solution of merely accidental occurrence.
At the autumnal term of the court just indicated,
when I had become a young practitioner
at the bar, a certain vixenish old
beldam was put upon trial for the offence
of maintaining this ill reputed establishment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Her demeanor was singularly exceptional;
for she did not scruple to interrupt
the proceedings with the most fluent
billingsgate, and upon receiving sentence
berated the presiding judge in language
betokening an extraordinary depth of desperate
hardihood. Inquiry revealed the
fact, that her solitary house, standing
upon an elevated plain of some extent,
the ground rising from the shores of Wenham
Lake, in front but little removed from
the road, and the space in its rear interspersed
with scattered groups of funereal
pines, had been the resort of various desperadoes,
several of whom had suffered
punishment for their crimes, and one of
them had not long before committed suicide
in jail, to escape public execution for
a most atrocious murder.
</p>
<p>
Late one day, in the beginning of the
following Spring, I happened to be called
upon to proceed to Boston, distant some
forty miles, upon the sudden requirement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
of certain business to be transacted the
next morning in the city. It was before
the railway was in operation, and to accomplish
the object in view I was to drive
this considerable distance in a chaise, at
night and alone. I was accustomed to
this mode of locomotion, in my attendance
upon the several sessions of the courts in
the county, and the idea of fear never
entered my mind. Accordingly, starting
about dusk, at half past ten o&#8217;clock of a
starlit night, I had reached a point in the
journey where the road rises by a gentle
ascent to the plain, on which stood &#8220;the
house of evil counsel.&#8221; All at once, the
scene and the narrative of the previous
Fall flashed upon my mind. Before leaving
home, I had bethought myself of a
brace of pistols in my possession, which I
had loaded and placed in the pockets of my
overcoat. And now comes the remarkable
circumstance to which I have already referred.
These weapons had been borrowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
of a friend, months before, when in the
midst of an unusually exciting election for
a member of congress, continuing some
two years, and stirring up extraordinary
rancor in the minds of some of the partisans
of the several candidates, I had
been threatened with violence, if I should
attend the polls. I had notified my opponents
that I should vote at a certain
hour, on the appointed day, and placed
these pistols in my pocket, by way of defence;
but nothing inconsistent with my
freedom of political action in fact occurred.
This was the only time in my life that I
had carried such implements, which were
then put aside in the drawer of a bureau,
and I have never thought it worth while
to take them since, except on the occasion
now referred to. I had thus provided
myself with them, on an entirely different
occasion, and took them with me, on a
sudden thought, as I was about to proceed
on my journey, more in the spirit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
youthful bravado, than with any other motive;
for the roads, at that period, were
considered perfectly safe, by night as well
as by day. As I have remarked, the
thought of the shrewish and abandoned old
woman, of her house and its evil companions,
occurred to me, as my horse slowly
ascended the rising ground towards the
plain. In a few minutes I was in the
neighborhood of a habitation which I
looked upon rather with detestation than
any emotion of alarm; when what was my
astonishment to behold a man&mdash;the sound
of the wheels of the chaise being doubtless
audible at some distance in the clear, still
night&mdash;come out of the gate in front of the
house and station himself in the middle of
the somewhat narrow highway. In fact,
the stranger was within a rod of the vehicle,
and must either be driven over or move
out of the way. At this unexpected encounter,
I own that my heart, as the saying
is, jumped into my mouth; but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
instantly drew and cocked my pistol, and
the click probably disturbing the nerves
of my proposed assailant, he turned aside
without offering further molestation. In
a few minutes, the lamps of the mail-stage,
as it turned Beverly Corner on its way
eastward, were a grateful spectacle, and
my onward journey was pursued without
other adventure. The driver of that stage
afterwards informed me, that the trunks
strapped to the rear of their coaches had
more than once been cut off in that very
neighborhood, and that on one occasion
beams had been placed in the road so that
the carriage would have been overturned,
unless they had been discovered in time,
and doubtless had been so placed for purposes
of robbery. I inquired, why investigation
did not take place on the spot;
but the reply was, that the passengers
were in haste to get on, were unarmed,
and perhaps timid, and preferred to remove
the obstacles and proceed upon their way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
The contrast, however, is striking, between
the habit of a farmer to leave his
door unfastened at night and the machinations
of rogues not a quarter of a mile
distant, who could be guilty of such crimes.
I believe, however, that the existence of
such a nest of villains was quite exceptional
at that period, and unknown to the
farmer, and that his sense of safety, without
the most ordinary means of protection
to his premises, was at that time the rule.
The reader may draw what conclusions he
pleases from the facts of my own personal
narrative.
</p>
<p>
I have remarked that politics, never
stagnant in our ancient communities, at
the period of my story, oftentimes grew
extremely warm, and then every leading
citizen took his personal part. Nor is it
strange that the survivors of those who
had borne their share in the Revolutionary
War, who had the traditions, at least, of
their fathers who served with the New
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
England troops, and followed the gallant
and generous Wolfe up the formidable
heights of Abraham, and after the victorious
field which cost that true hero his life,
stood triumphant, under the Red Cross
banner, upon the subjugated ramparts of
Quebec, should exhibit marked peculiarities
of character; should hold fast to
strong opinions; and indeed should manifest
that individuality and originality of
thought and action which is scarcely witnessed
in the promiscuous crowd of our
own tamer times. Instead of that indifference,
the bane of a republic, among the
upper class, the result of accumulated
wealth and luxurious habits, the chief men
of both parties stood at the door of the
Town Hall, on days of election, distributing
votes, and encouraging the timid and
the doubtful, and their influence was effectively
felt in the direction of public affairs,
which now seem mostly to be left to the
management of the least competent, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
often the most ignorant, mercenary, and
corrupt. I firmly believe that the equal,
if not preëminent position long maintained
by Massachusetts, among rivals vastly superior
in territory and population, was owing
to the active interest formerly taken
by her leading men of all professions and
occupations in the politics of the day, and
that thus the sources of political well being
were kept comparatively pure. At
present, these men take their political
opinions from the newspaper they read, and
trouble themselves very little further about
a matter in which their own stake, one
would think, would rouse them to exertion,
from the promptings of enlightened self-interest,
if not from the more generous
emotions of public spirit.
</p>
<p>
On one occasion, when some eager dispute
had arisen, as to which of the two
parties actually preponderated, for the balance
sometimes wavered from one side to
the other, it was determined to poll the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
town; that is, to assemble all citizens entitled
to vote in the Town Hall, to divide
them personally according to their several
politics and by actual count to ascertain
which was the strongest in point of numbers.
I happened to be present, as a boy
who heard political questions discussed
with animation at home, and was curious
to witness the scene, which was one really
of the intensest interest. The selectmen
occupied their tribune, at the head of the
Hall, and the meeting was presided over
by their chairman, a man of imposing
height and general personal development,
with flowing white locks, who commanded
the respect of all parties. His father had
been a soldier of Wolfe, and he and his associates
were on the Federal side. When
the parties were arranged for the enumeration,
one worthy individual, who kept the
principal tavern of the town, stood hesitating,
at the end of the hall, between the
two files; for, in fact, both parties of necessity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
made use of his house, by turns, in
commemoration of some public event, or
for festive purposes, which, to tell the
truth; were frequently coming round; for
the liquor was both better and cheaper
than in these degenerate days. I shall
never forget the start which the sonorous
voice of the chairman gave me, as he
bawled out,&mdash;&#8220;None of that, Jenkins; we
can&#8217;t have any shirking here; you must
take one side or the other,&#8221;&mdash;and he did,
amidst the tumultuous laughter with which
the Hall resounded. The contest was a
good-natured one, and I have no doubt
which party proved victorious, considering
that the prevailing sentiment of the town
was pretty well evidenced by the political
leanings of the <i>Board</i>; but at this late day
it is of little consequence to authenticate
the fact.
</p>
<p>
The father of the sturdy chairman had
set up the tavern, after returning from the
expedition to Quebec, which he called the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Wolfe House</span>, in memory of his commander,
General James Wolfe, who is presented
in such a pleasing light in Thackeray&#8217;s
&#8220;Virginians,&#8221; and, as a noble-minded
man and true hero, deserved all which could
be said in his praise. In after days, and I
believe it is still there, the sign was suspended
in front of the hotel, which took
the place of that destroyed by the &#8220;Great
Fire.&#8221; The brave general wore his red
coat and cocked hat, all through the War
of the Revolution and that of 1812-14,
without molestation from colonial rebels,
or Yankees fighting against the mother
country, by land and by sea. The tavern
was kept for a long time by a shrewd and
active host, who had a keen eye to the
main chance. Among his dinner guests
were farmers who attended market, and
others, content to take their meals at half
price, after the chief company had finished
that repast. Of these was one Major
Muncheon, somewhat celebrated for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
remarkable powers of making away with
whatever the table furnished. One day,
Wilkins, the host, who was addicted to a
slightly nasal intonation, addressed him,
when he had just risen from his seat,&mdash;&#8220;Major,
I can&#8217;t dine you any more for
twenty-five cents.&#8221; &#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked
the well-satisfied trencherman. &#8220;I tell
you, Major,&#8221; said his host, &#8220;the very vegetables
you&#8217;ve eaten cost two and three
pence&#8221; (37&frac12; cents), &#8220;saying nothing of the
meat and pies.&#8221; &#8220;Pho! Wilkins,&#8221; remonstrated
the farmer, &#8220;it&#8217;s only the second
table.&#8221; &#8220;Second table!&#8221; replied the host;
&#8220;why, Major, if you had sat down to the
first table, there wouldn&#8217;t have been no
second.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But if parties in those times were often
hotly opposed, there was one occasion,
every year, when a broader sentiment of
patriotism warmed the hearts of all in the
fellowship of a common cause. The Anniversary
of Independence was duly commemorated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
by appropriate exercises for
considerably more than half a century in
our spirited town, and with a general loosening
of party ties on the occasion, until
the War of 1812, when the parties conducted
separate celebrations, though the
orators were always only too apt to tighten
them again by untimely political allusions,
in the narrower sense of the phrase.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
</p>
<p>
On one of these anniversaries, the orator
expectant we will call Mr. Moses, a member
of the Bar, who had already acquired distinction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
and was afterwards a leader in his
profession, well known in the county of
Essex. It was in reference to this gentleman,
that an ambitious colored person of
that day instructed the shoemaker he employed,
that he wanted &#8220;his boots to have
as much creak in them as Squire Moses&#8217;s.&#8221;
On the day before the services were to take
place, the orator repaired to the meeting-house
appointed for the purpose, in order
to rehearse his performance, and having
mounted the stairs to the pulpit by a back-entrance,
and probably wearing boots, at
this time, of less distinctive resonance, did
not attract the attention of an old woman
who was on her knees scrubbing the
broad aisle. The speaker had a melodious
and ringing voice, and began, I suppose,&mdash;&#8220;Friends
and fellow-countrymen!&#8221; &#8220;Oh,
lud-a-mercy!&#8221; cried the ancient female on
the floor, starting to her feet, with uplifted
hands. The occupant of the pulpit was
a very polite person. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
alarmed, madam,&#8221; cried he; &#8220;it&#8217;s only
Moses.&#8221; &#8220;Moses!&#8221; screamed the woman&mdash;&#8220;Moses
is come! Moses is come!&#8221; and
not much to the credit of a piety which
ought to have felt so highly favored by a
vision of the great prophet, rushed from
the church into the street in an agony
of terror, spreading consternation in the
neighborhood by her outcries, until the
mystery was speedily cleared up.

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p>
I know there are those who will kindly
regard these reminiscences of things, trifling,
it may be, in themselves, but affording
a glimpse of manners perhaps already
forgotten by most or all of those who were
formerly more or less conversant with
them, and which may prove of some interest
in the future. We had spent our
Thanksgiving at home, in the year 18&mdash;,
but went all together to the farm of our
uncle Richard, who was of the Episcopal
Church, for the celebration of Christmas;
for many of his persuasion, at that time,
regarded &#8220;Thanksgiving&#8221; pretty much as
the Highlander, in Scott&#8217;s novel, did &#8220;ta
little government Sunday, tat tey call ta
Fast.&#8221; He was a well-to-do farmer, at a
place within easy reach of the town in
which we lived, and where very few were at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
all rich, even according to the former moderate
standard of wealth, and most people
were poor, or at least depended on their
daily labor for their daily bread. Those
were very hard times following upon the
war; and that had followed fast upon the
Great Fire, which reduced to ruin almost
the entire central business part of the town.
Our family had suffered private losses, too,
by a swindling failure on an extensive
scale,&mdash;a rare incident in those days;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and again by the embargo and the war,
most of my mother&#8217;s limited means having
been invested in one vessel after another,
employed in the coasting trade, and this
source of income at length stopped altogether.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Still, people bore up bravely
against these misfortunes, and showed quite
as much spirit and hardihood as in these
latter times, and got along decently, after
a fashion. To be sure, the proclamation
of Peace, a few years before, had revived
all hearts; though I heard of a washerwoman
engaged in her avocation, while
the bells were ringing, who, on learning
the cause of jubilation, peevishly exclaimed,&mdash;&#8220;Peace!
peace! what&#8217;s peace, when
there&#8217;s no water?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Our Thanksgiving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
had been a cheerful one, though colored, as
such anniversaries are likely to be, with
recollections of the absent, or the dead;
for the memory of my father was always
present to my mother, then and during a
long widowhood of almost half a century,
and my older brothers were at sea. My
mother was an excellent housekeeper, and
we had plenty of the usual belongings of
the festival, so eagerly looked forward to
by the young, and something to bestow
upon others not so well supplied. It was
the practice of some of this class to knock
at the doors of those thought to be better
off, on the evening before, begging &#8220;something
for Thanksgiving;&#8221; and, by way of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
a joke, the children of comfortable neighbors
and friends would often array themselves
in cast-off bizarre habiliments, and
come in bands of three or four to the
houses of those whom they knew, preferring
the same request. Ordinarily, the
disguise was readily detected. Sometimes
the little mimics would come in,
and keep up the show and the fun for
a while; but for the most part their courage
failed them at the threshold, and they
<ins class="trnote" title="skurried">scurried</ins> away, shouting for glee, almost
before they got any answer to their mock
petitions. It was a queer fancy, thus to
simulate poverty; but kings have sometimes
done so. Did not James of Scotland
find amusement in roaming through a
portion of his domain, as a &#8220;gaberlunzie-man?&#8221;
Yes&mdash;and even composed a famous
ballad to celebrate his exploits in
this humble way. In the evening, we had
a lively company, regaled with nuts, apples,
and cider; and my grandmother, who indulged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
in the old-fashioned practice, that
is for females, of smoking a pipe, sat in the
chimney-corner, where a genial wood-fire
was brightly blazing, for coal was then a
thing unknown in family consumption,
duly furnished with the implement, and
sometimes called out to us,&mdash;&#8220;A-done,
children, a-done,&#8221; when in anywise annoyed
by us, and occasionally would sing
us an old song, of which I remember
only &#8220;Robert Kid&#8221; and &#8220;A galliant ship,
launched off the stocks, from Old England
she came,&#8221; etc.; and, often when a storm
was raging without, repeating to us the
rhymes,&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;How little do&#8221; (pronounced doe) &#8220;we think, or know,<br />

<p>
But we had a livelier time at Uncle
Richard&#8217;s; for there were more of us and
merrier. Of course, those of the household
who could be spared from domestic duties
had attended service in the morning, and
some of us from the town had also appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
at church; for though our branch
of the family were now Presbyterians, we
remembered that our common ancestor
and the company who came over with him,
a couple of centuries and more before that
time, were of the Church of England, only
protesting against the abuses which had
crept into it; and Uncle Richard carefully
preserved, with the genealogy of the family
on this side the water, the Orders in
Council, prescribing for the passengers, by
the &#8220;Mary and John,&#8221; of which my ancestor
was one, then lying in the Thames, in
the year 1633, amongst other regulations,
the daily service to be observed on board,
according to the ordinances of the Prayer
Book.
</p>
<p>
No doubt the dinner was all which the
domestic celebration of the festival imports,
for the farm was well stocked with
every description of creature, and with
most other things needful for the purpose;
but I may be excused if I remember none
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
of the particulars, now that so many years
have intervened. I know that Uncle Richard
always prided himself upon his excellent
cider, and there is little question that
there was a due allowance of spirits, which
most persons of fair means kept, in those
days, in decanters openly ranged upon the
parlor sideboard. Indeed, about the same
period, while I was a student at a famous
Academy not many miles distant from our
own home, the English teacher, an orthodox
clergyman of high repute, who cultivated
a few acres of land at the place
where he lived on the outskirts of the town,
invited a few of the pupils, myself in the
number, to assist him in making hay, one
play-afternoon. The boys had a good
frolic, and, after work was ended, our master
treated us to milk-punch, a highly
agreeable, but rather exhilarating beverage.
Our uncle&#8217;s house was of the old-fashioned
New England description, pleasantly
facing the south, with a high-peaked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
roof, which descended, in the opposite
quarter, to not much more than a man&#8217;s
stature from the ground. In front was a
spacious green yard, leading on one side
to the garden for vegetables and trees of
the choicer kinds of fruit, and sprinkled
here and there with bunches of gay flowers;
and at the entrance gate by the road
two magnificent elms, of an age and height
which denoted that they must have given
shade to several past generations from the
summer heat, flung out drooping branches
which extended a very great distance from
the parent trunks. After dinner, our host
entertained us with a narrative of his recent
visit to the capital town of Boston,
to testify, in company with a former neighbor,
now resident there, in behalf of his
hired man, Jasper Towne, of English birth,
who having, duly and at a long term beforehand,
declared his intention, in proper
form, was at length, after a continuous
residence of fourteen years in the United
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
States, admitted by the Federal Court to
all the rights and privileges which free citizenship
could confer upon him. The scene
in court my uncle thought peculiarly solemn
and impressive. The candidate for
the franchise was strictly questioned by
the presiding justice, in open court, with
regard to his origin and his past life. The
witnesses were subjected to a similar scrutiny
as to his character and habits, and
their judgment of his fitness for the responsible
position and the new duties he
was about to assume. When this part of
the transaction was completed, the oaths
of renunciation of allegiance to every foreign
power, prince, or potentate whatsoever,
and the oath to support the Constitution
of the United States were administered
to him by the clerk in a manner to
fix it in his mind that it was a very serious
business, indeed, in which he had just been
engaged. Thereupon, the judge addressed
him in language of congratulation and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
counsel, and our newly-made fellow-countryman
respectfully departed from the tribunal,
conscious that he had attained no
mean privilege and had secured a safeguard,
like that, by the declaration of which
the Apostle of the Gentiles stayed the uplifted
hands of his persecutors, and caused
them to tremble at the thought of misuse
or degradation inflicted upon a Roman citizen.
Now, I believe, whatever is left of the
ceremony upon such occasions is slurred
over in a clerk&#8217;s office, or the part performed
in court scarcely attracts the attention
of the magistrate upon the bench.
The moral of this change of practice may
be left to the reflection of the judicious
reader. But it was something then to be,
or to be made an American citizen.
</p>
<p>
Not long before this, there had been an
earthquake, which, though of brief duration,
had caused no little alarm,&mdash;a terrific
sound always, however slight the shock,&mdash;and
in this instance making houses tremble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
and shaking down various articles from
their places of deposit. In the early days
of the colony, these phenomena were not
uncommon, and are said to have been of no
little power in this part of New England.
Uncle Richard described the recent one
as rumbling under the frozen ground leading
to his barns, as if a line of heavily-loaded
wagons had rolled over it. Being
something of a philosopher, and better educated
than usual at the time, he explained
the cause of such physical occurrences to
us young ones.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the water in
certain parts of the earth becomes intensely
heated and lets off a quantity of
steam of amazing expansive power. It is
like a tea-kettle, which if you shut the nozzle
tight, may either throw off the lid with
great force, or the kettle itself bursts with
the strain upon it. So the steam, under
the earth, heated by central fires, and gaining
immense volume and power, seeks the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
hollows in its neighborhood, and rushes
into them with a force which produces the
concussion and the rumbling sound; and
the shaking of the surface which we perceive
is really like the commotion in the
tea-kettle and the trembling of the vessel
when the steam has no vent. It is an
awful thought that we thus live over the
action of these subterranean fires; but they
are in the control of the Almighty, and all
we have to do is to submit to God&#8217;s will
and merciful providence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
St. Paul&#8217;s Church, of which Uncle Richard
was a vestryman, owed its origin to
the separation of certain persons from the
Congregational mode of worship, and the
formation of a society for the resumption
of the Protestant Episcopal pattern, as long
ago as the year 1712. Their place of worship
they named Queen Anne&#8217;s Chapel,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
in honor of the sovereign &#8220;at home,&#8221; the
last of the direct Stuart line, whose royal
person, it is said, having grown too unwieldy
to permit horseback exercise, she
was in the habit of following the hunt,
of which she was passionately fond, driving
herself, helter-skelter, in a one-horse
chaise. She has the credit of having bestowed
some endowment upon the Chapel,
and the Bishop of London presented it
with a bell; which, if all accounts be true,
still hangs in the steeple of a congregational
meeting-house within the precinct
of the &#8220;Plains,&#8221; where the Chapel once
stood. For that edifice, probably not having
been very substantially built, and being
situated on a barren tract of land, afterwards
known as &#8220;Grasshopper Plains,&#8221;
and, for the convenience of the scattered
parishioners, placed at a distance from every
one of them, and hence subject to various
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
causes of dilapidation, especially when St.
Paul&#8217;s, within the town, was in process of
construction, at length fell to ruin; and the
bell was carried privately away&mdash;so runs
the tale&mdash;and was long buried in the
ground, but has now for many years summoned
the people to a style of worship
which would have appealed in vain to the
good Bishop of London for any such donation.
It may be supposed that it could
not be identified, after its interment, and
perhaps the obliteration, naturally or otherwise,
of its peculiar marks; or the successors
of Queen Anne&#8217;s at St. Paul&#8217;s, built
about thirty years after the former, would
have reclaimed their property.
</p>
<p>
The motives of those who thus revived
the relation of their ancestors with the
Established Church were not altogether
pious; but the fact <ins class="trnote" title="incontestibly">incontestably</ins> proves,
that after nearly a century of separation
from that establishment, the objections to
it, in the minds of many of the children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
of the colonists, were by no means insurmountable.
Indeed, it was about a question
of parish taxation that they differed
with their co-religionists. The place selected
for the meeting-house was so far
distant from the homes of many of the
parish, that they could not attend without
great inconvenience, and yet they were
required to pay the parish rates for the
support of the minister. They remonstrated
and appealed in vain to the civil
authorities in the colony and to those in
England, for relief; for the law was clearly
against them, unless they chose to conform
to the doctrines and discipline of the Established
Church. Finding nothing in the
Thirty-nine Articles inconsistent with the
faith they professed, they easily reconciled
themselves to the ceremonies, and thus
succeeded in their object of removing from
their shoulders an involuntary burden.
</p>
<p>
As may be imagined, at first and for
years afterwards, they remained but &#8220;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
feeble folk,&#8221; regarded with suspicion and
dislike by the more narrow-minded of their
contemporaries, though the days were long
gone by, when an Episcopalian, especially
if suspected of a leaning towards Popery,
was set in the pillory or the stocks. The
Church, however, had been long flourishing,
in my youth, and I was always particularly
impressed when I attended service
there, as I always did on Christmas Day,
with the organ, an instrument utterly unknown
in our other places of public worship,
and with the comfort diffused by the
large Russian stove which projected from a
corner of the building; while we, for long
years afterwards, shivered in our meeting-houses
of a cold Sunday. To be sure, the
younger children carried their mothers&#8217;
hand-stoves, constructed of tin in a frame
of wood and pierced with holes in the top,
to let out such heat as could be communicated
by a small pan of coals covered with
ashes. But for the male part of the congregation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
who despised such a luxury, it
was almost impossible to avoid occasionally
striking the benumbed feet together, and
sometimes the clatter was almost as considerable,
as in letting down the seats after
the long prayer, especially if that proved
to be a very protracted exercise. But I
have known young ladies so indifferent to
the severity of the weather, as to attend
meeting, on very cold days of winter, with
bare arms. What would delicate ladies,
who, wrapped in warm furs, listen to service
in a heated church, think of such exposure
now? On one particular occasion,
however, our minister announced the text,&mdash;&#8220;Who
can stand before His cold?&#8221; and
closed the services with the usual blessing,
a little to the dissatisfaction, I think, of the
more staid members of the congregation,
who having come through cold and snow,
or a furious wintry storm, it might be, to
hear a sermon, were not altogether contented
to miss the expected edification, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
perhaps the opportunity of criticising the
discourse. Indeed, I know not what my
respected great grandsire, an elder of the
church in his day, would have said to such
defection from spiritual needs towards indulgence
in carnal comfort. For it is said,
that when some less searching and thorough-going
preacher of the word exchanged
with our minister, or casually officiated for
him, the old gentleman tottered out of the
meeting-house, leaning on his staff, and
with elevated eyebrows muttered pretty
audibly to those near him,&mdash;&#8220;Peas in a
bladder&mdash;thorns under a pot&mdash;no food
to-day!&#8221; And however it might be with
many of his neighbors, not the minutest
particle of the quality of original Puritanism
had been shaken out of his system by the
changes of the times. The family tradition
is, that before the sunset of Saturday everything
necessary for the support of nature
upon the Sabbath was cooked and in readiness.
Whether he allowed the accustomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
beans and rye and Indian bread to remain
in the oven subject to the working heat,
over Saturday night, I am not able to certify.
But in the intervals of public worship
on Sunday,&mdash;a term, by the way, which he
would have scorned to employ,&mdash;the family
was assembled and ranged around the
walls of the room, and the reading of Scripture,
or of some well-worn book of devotion,
was proceeded with, while the head of
the family sat in the centre, with a stick in
his hand long enough to reach the head
and shoulders of any inattentive or unquiet
child.

When a trader failed, as was rarely the case at that
primitive period, his sign was taken down at night, to
the wonder of the public in the morning, and he remained
fast locked from the sheriff, or too inquisitive
callers, in his house, until the disposition of his creditors
became known,&mdash;dependent upon their confidence in his
good intentions, or their sympathy with his unexpected
misfortunes.

An anecdote quite parallel to this is to be found in
the now late lamented Dean Ramsay&#8217;s &#8220;Reminiscences.&#8221;
He relates, as a specimen of the cool Scottish matter-of-fact
view of things, the following communication of a correspondent:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The back windows of the house where he was brought
up looked upon the Greyfriars&#8217; Church that was burned
down. On the Sunday morning in which that event took
place, as they were all preparing to go to church, the
flames began to burst forth; the young people screamed
from the back part of the house, &#8216;A fire! a fire!&#8217; and all
was in a state of confusion and alarm. The housemaid
was not at home, it being her turn for the Sunday &#8216;out.&#8217;
Kitty, the cook, was taking her place, and performing
her duties. The old woman was always very particular
on the subject of her responsibility on such occasions,
and came panting and hobbling upstairs from the lower
regions, and exclaimed, &#8216;Oh what is&#8217;t, what is&#8217;t?&#8217; &#8216;O,
Kitty, look here, the Greyfriars&#8217; Church is on fire!&#8217; &#8216;Is
that a&#8217;, Miss? What a fright ye geed me! I thought ye
said the parlor fire was out.&#8217;&#8221;

It was, I believe, the oldest Episcopal Church in
Massachusetts, with the exception of King&#8217;s Chapel,
in Boston, a small wooden structure, which stood upon
the place where the stone edifice of that name is now
situated.

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p>
An aged friend, years ago deceased, who
had seen much of the world, once observed
to me, that he had never seen a more
&#8220;scrupulous people,&#8221; to use his expression,
than our Presbyterian congregation. The
clergy of the town were always distinguished,
at a period when to be a clergyman
was to be much more an object of
reverence than in these latter days, and
when a boy in the street would scarcely
venture to pass one, on the opposite sidewalk,
without pulling off his cap. But
they set their people an excellent example,
though they did not always escape the
censure of the over &#8220;scrupulous.&#8221; For
instance, Mr. Murray, the accomplished
scholar and divine to whom reference has
already been made, was known to take no
dinner in the interval of public worship,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
substituting for that repast a slice or two
of bread and a few glasses of wine. Why
such a fact, when everybody drank more or
less wine, or something stronger, every day
of the week, should have alarmed the conscience
of Miss Betty Timmins, a maiden
lady of a certain age, it seems difficult to
conjecture. Nevertheless, she made a solemn
call, one day, upon her pastor, and
with such apology as she could muster for
impertinence&mdash;at length out with it: &#8220;I
must tell you, reverend sir, they do say you
drink.&#8221; &#8220;Drink! Miss Timmins,&#8221; said Mr.
Murray; &#8220;to be sure I do, don&#8217;t you? How
can anybody live without drinking?&#8221; and
the discomfited spinster retreated. Mr.
Murray had a fund of humor. The parsonage
was close by the house of his parishioner,
the sheriff, and the adjoining jail and
whipping-post in the charge of that officer,
and in the last illness of the minister the
official was in the habit of taking him to a
drive. Once, as he was getting into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
chaise, a friend passed by and he called
out, &#8220;If you see any one inquiring for me,
tell him the last you saw of me I was in
the hands of the sheriff.&#8221; But after his
time, and at the period of which I am writing,
we had no less than three English
ministers settled in the town, all educated
upon the foundation of the celebrated
Countess of Huntington. I recall, with
vivid recollection, the figure of one of these
worthies who called himself an &#8220;Independent,&#8221;
as he proceeded to meeting on a
Sunday: his high cocked hat, his flowing,
black curled locks,&mdash;more in the cavalier
than the Puritan fashion; his long blue
cloak over his clerical gown, his bands, his
knee-breeches,&mdash;objected to by a fastidious
young lady, as &#8220;short pantaloons,&#8221;&mdash;his
square shoe-buckles, and his ponderous
cane. His person was somewhat short
and thick, whence &#8220;lewd fellows of the
baser sort&#8221; sometimes irreverently called
him the &#8220;The Jack of Clubs.&#8221; But he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
a really good man, with the most powerful
voice I remember to have heard, and
he preached, always an unwritten sermon,
but with heads set down, anything but
smooth things to his numerous congregation.
Towards the close of his life he used
to remark, that when he first came to this
country, the topic of sermons was &#8220;Jesus
Christ and Him crucified; now it was
nothing but niggers and rum.&#8221; He was
good at retort. Early one Monday morning
he was going home from the market,
with some mackerel which he had just purchased
strung upon his cane. &#8220;Mr. Milton,&#8221;
said some passer-by, &#8220;them mackerel
was caught Sunday.&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;that ain&#8217;t the fishes&#8217; fault.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
One burden of this worthy minister&#8217;s
Sunday prayer, during the sessions of Congress
and of the State legislature, was,
&#8220;Counsel our councillors, and teach our
senators wisdom.&#8221; By many of the stronger
faith of an elder day, his fervent supplications
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
were believed to exercise a specific
influence upon the atmosphere, particularly
in bringing needed rain at a dry time. I
have often heard it said, after the drought
had continued a good while,&mdash;&#8220;Well, Milton
has prayed for rain and now we shall
have it.&#8221; This reminds me of an anecdote
appropriate to the topic, in that very entertaining
book, Dean Ramsay&#8217;s &#8220;Reminiscences
of Scottish Life and Character.&#8221;
At one time when the crops were much
laid by continuous rains, and wind was
earnestly desired in order to restore them
to a condition fit for the sickle,&mdash;&#8220;A minister,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;in his Sabbath services
expressed their wants in prayer, as follows:
&#8216;O Lord, we pray thee to send us wind, no
a rantin&#8217; tantin,&#8217; tearin&#8217; wind, but a noohin&#8217;,
(noughin?) soughin&#8217;, winnin&#8217; wind.&#8217;&#8221; In
like manner, I have heard of a prayer
preferred by a somewhat simple New Englander,
who was overheard offering his petition
behind a clump of bushes in a field:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
&#8220;O Lord, I want a new coat&mdash;good cloth&mdash;none
of your coarse, flimsy, slimsy,
sleazy kind of stuff, but a good piece of
thick, warm, comfortable broadcloth&mdash;such
as Bill Hale wears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
It must be admitted that the reverend
person was rather rough in manner; but
he had a truly kind heart. Like John
Wesley, he was unfortunate in his domestic
relations; a circumstance which doubtless
tended somewhat to lessen the amiability
of an originally good disposition. But, notwithstanding
his various trials and we fear
conflicts at home, no one questioned his
piety. Indeed, one well acquainted with his
character and experiences, when his death
was announced, at once exclaimed,&mdash;&#8220;What
a change! From pitching skillets, to handling
harps!&#8221; There could be no greater
contrast than in the person and character
of our long and well-beloved Presbyterian
minister, graceful in person, courteous and
affable in demeanor, accomplished in ancient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
learning and in that portion of English
literature which is styled classical; a
devoted and affectionate pastor, a most able
and persuasive preacher; of whom President
Dwight, of Yale, is reported to have
said, that there had been scarcely such
a writer of pure English since Addison.
With the exception of some failure of physical
powers, towards the close of his life, he
retained these admirable characteristics and
accomplishments to the end of his more
than ninety years. He always preached in
gown and bands, with black gloves upon
his hands, his nether limbs encased in
small-clothes and silk stockings, until in
later life he adopted the prevailing mode.
We always knew when he intended to
preach, because through several intervening
yards and gardens we could see from
our house the light in his study, at a distance,
of a Saturday night. His morning
discourses were usually admirable expositions
of Scripture delivered without notes;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
his afternoon sermons were written exercises,
and we so depended upon both, that
it was a disappointment when we discovered
that he was to exchange, by the absence
of the usual light. He would descend
from the contemplation of the highest
themes, which address themselves to human
reason and imagination, and from the relaxation
of reading &#8220;Tully,&#8221; or Horace, or
Pope, who was a special favorite with him,
to the preparation of his fire-wood for domestic
use, and doubtless this accustomed
saw-horse practice tended very much to the
promotion and continuance both of his bodily
and mental health. In my childhood, he
taught me and other, I fear, reluctant pupils
all we were capable of learning of the Westminster
Assembly&#8217;s Shorter Catechism,
contained, at that time, in a small but miscellaneous
volume called the Primer. He
was a great lover of the writings of Cowper,
which name, in the English manner,
he always pronounced Cooper, and of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Psalms and Hymns and the lyrical productions,
in general, of Dr. Watts; and long
after I had grown up, he pointed out to me
a verse in one of those Hymns, remarking
upon a point which I do not remember to
have seen noticed elsewhere, that it presented
the finest specimen of alliteration
in the language, as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>
<tr><td><p>&#8220;How vain are all things here below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How false and yet how fair!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every sweet a snare.&#8221;
</p></td></tr>

<p>
The eventual condition and standing of
our Episcopal Church may be inferred from
the fact, that its Rector, in early times, was
chosen Bishop of the diocese, a dignity
which he long piously and humbly enjoyed.
Along the beautiful street on which St.
Paul&#8217;s stood, and in its immediate neighborhood,
were some of the more elegant
residences of the town, and an air of superior
gentility seemed to pervade the precinct,
so that some caviller saw fit to call
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
it St. James&#8217;s, in allusion to the Christian
name of the excellent Rector who succeeded
the venerable Bishop. He was, indeed,
a most devoted churchman, looking
upon all persons outside of his communion
as sheep wandering from the fold, and used
to say, that he considered the whole town
as really belonging to his parish. He was
a person very highly esteemed for his piety
and sincerity, and as evidence of this repute,
and of liberality on both sides, he
preached, by invitation, and read the service
in the Presbyterian meeting-house, on
one occasion, at least, when our minister
was absent and his own pulpit was supplied.
We were then under another pastor;
but some years before this manifestation
of truly Christian toleration a
controversy arose between the Rector and
our Presbyterian clergyman, in regard to
the obligatory observance of Christmas.
It was conducted in the newspaper of the
town, then published only on two days of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
the week, and to the multitude of readers
appeared more spirited than edifying, as
is the case with most polemical disputes.
The worthy Episcopal Doctor had asserted
on Christmas Day, that the observance of
that festival was of universal Christian obligation.
The Presbyterian Doctor took up
the cudgels to demonstrate, that, although
it was proper and reasonable enough to
keep the day, as a matter of religious edification,
like a lecture-day, for example, by
those who saw fit to do so, yet there was
no authority, in this respect, binding upon
the consciences of those who chose to
disregard it. Both of the disputants were
acknowledged gentlemen and scholars; but
after much argument and learning wasted
upon the subject, it is to be feared that the
controversy, through the medium of a public
journal, between two such highly respected
controversialists, on a topic of
religious practice, only gave too much occasion
to the scoffer. Indeed, Johnnie Favor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
the Episcopal sexton&#8217;s helper, one of
those persons, reputed half-witted, who
sometimes make very apposite remarks,
observed,&mdash;&#8220;Well&mdash;Christmas here, or
Christmas there, I&#8217;m not so narrer-contracted
as to like to see the surplices of
two such good men as your Doctor and
my Doctor draggled in the dirt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Certainly, a tone of unusual refinement
pervaded the better educated class of the
community in the old town, at the period
of this relation, and not a little stateliness
of manner was kept up by some of the
older families. Indeed, I think they would
compare very favorably in point of intelligence
and manners, with persons of a
similar class, as described by the great
authorities heretofore referred to, and
others, who have given us vivid pictures
of social life in the Scottish capital. To be
sure, the colonial days of distinct social
rank had long gone by. But, half a generation
before, the town had been one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
most flourishing and wealthy in New England,
and to the counting-houses of its principal
merchants young men resorted, even
from the capital of the State, to learn the
art and practice of business. Those who
filled the several learned professions were
persons of the highest eminence in their
several callings,&mdash;drawing pupils around
them who afterwards, and on wider fields
of action, attained great names and some
of whom occupied the loftiest civil positions
in the land.
</p>
<p>
Among the students, for example, in the
office of that great lawyer and judge, Chief
Justice Parsons, while he practised at the
Bar, and who subsequently attained eminence,
were John Quincy Adams, afterwards
President of the United States, and Rufus
King, afterwards Senator in Congress from
the State of New York, and twice Minister
Plenipotentiary to Great Britain; and Robert
Treat Paine, so celebrated in his day, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
an orator and poet.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Of one of these eminent
persons I heard a story, formerly, from a
friend of very high character as a man and a
lawyer, the late Hon. William Baylies, of
West Bridgewater, Massachusetts. It seems
that while Mr. King, then a young man, was
in the practice of his profession in Boston
he was detained in attendance upon court
at Plymouth, until late on Saturday evening.
It was necessary for him to be at
home seasonably on Monday morning, and
accordingly he mounted his horse early on
Sunday, the ordinary mode of travel, in
those days, and proceeded leisurely on his
way. It was summer time; and in passing
through the township of Hanover, in Plymouth
County, he approached a plain wooden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
structure by the roadside, in which, as he
could see by the assemblage within, the
door and windows being open, that it was
a time of religious service. Alighting, out
of deference to the character of the day, he
hitched his horse and quietly entered the
building. It proved to be a Quaker meeting,
and perfect silence prevailed. At
length tiring of this state of things, Mr.
King arose and began to address the assembly
upon topics suitable to the day.
He was an uncommonly handsome young
man, and then and ever afterwards distinguished
for extraordinary powers of eloquence.
The Quakers listened with mute
amazement and admiration to the discourse
of some twenty minutes&#8217; duration, when
the speaker slipped out, remounted, and
proceeded on his journey. The incident
was the occasion of great and mysterious
interest, for a long time afterwards, in the
quiet country neighborhood. No imagination
could conceive who the wonderful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
speaker might be, and many insisted it
must have been, indeed, &#8220;an angel from
heaven.&#8221; Some years afterwards, at the
session of a Constitutional Convention in
Massachusetts, Mr. King rose to make a
motion. He had no sooner begun, than
a Quaker member started up from a back
seat, and, carried away by the first glimpse
at solution of the long-standing mystery,
cried out, &#8220;That&#8217;s the man that spoke in
our meetin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Provision for the instruction of youth was
liberal, and not long previously the most
famous, and I believe the longest established
academy of the day, flourished in the
immediate neighborhood, in all its glory.
Of the school-books then in use, I cannot
but think that one in particular, Murray&#8217;s
English Reader, was a better manual than
any other which has since been produced.
For it was mainly made up of extracts from
the writings of the best authors, in the
best age of English literature, and I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
answer that its lessons were calculated to
make impressions on the youthful mind,
never to be forgotten. But the prevalent
idea, of late years, seems to have been to
nationalize school-books, so as to narrow
their teachings, and thus to make our future
fellow-citizens partisans instead of men.
But literature and learning are confined
to no age or nation; and meaning in no
sense to say a word which could abate the
ardor of manly patriotism in any bosom, it
is certain that much is to be learned from
the history of other people beside our own;
and I suppose there are standards of high
intellectual attainment in the past,&mdash;in
poetry and eloquence, and various ranges
of thought and expression,&mdash;which never
have been and are not likely to be surpassed.
The deluge of modern transitory
literature had not then begun to flow. But,
to say nothing of the &#8220;Scottish Chiefs,&#8221;
and &#8220;Thaddeus of Warsaw,&#8221; over the pages
of which, doubtless, millions of youthful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
eyes have formerly shed copious tears, we
had Miss Edgeworth&#8217;s writings, those of
Mrs. Grant, of Laggan, the novels of Charlotte
Smith, the Memoirs of Baron Trenck,
and, perused a little stealthily, Peregrine
Pickle and Roderick Random; and in
poetry Henry Kirke White and Montgomery
were favorites; nor am I ashamed to
say, that Cottle&#8217;s &#8220;Alfred&#8221; was read aloud
at our fireside of evenings, with an interest
due to the story, perhaps, as much as to its
poetical ability. Original American productions
were few; the importation of new
works from abroad was not large, and the
demand for reprints a good deal limited.
But we had the well-known books of sterling
value at command, and our publishers
occasionally favored us with new editions.
One of my early studies was Guthrie&#8217;s
Grammar of Geography, a ponderous volume
of English manufacture, which belonged
in our family; and I was fascinated
with Pope at almost as early an age as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
that in which he first &#8220;lisped in numbers.&#8221;
I see, by the way, that Forster, in his Life
of Dickens, quotes from a letter of Scott, in
which he refers to the scarcity of books at
Edinburgh in his time.
</p>
<p>
In connection with this reference to our
means of intellectual cultivation, I am reminded
of an incident illustrative of a faculty
commonly attributed to Yankees, that
is New Englanders, though there is reason
to believe that some other parts of the
country are quite as liberally gifted with
the qualities of &#8220;Yorkshire.&#8221; It affords a
striking instance of shrewdness on the one
side, and of lamentable deficiency of it on
the other. This was before the town had
exchanged its original simpler mode of regulating
its municipal affairs for the form
of a city government. On a certain occasion
the School Committee became dissatisfied
with the master of one of the higher
schools, after a brief trial of his qualities,
and, as delicately as the subject permitted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
requested him to resign his place. The
master was not a native of the town, or of
the &#8220;region round about,&#8221; so that it was a
mere question of qualifications, real or
otherwise, between himself and his employers.
He demurred, unless his salary
were paid him for the unexpired considerable
part of the year for which he alleged
himself to have been engaged; but finally
consented, if the chairman of the committee
would only furnish him with a certificate
of honorable discharge. The chairman,
at this easy rate of saving the town&#8217;s
money, wrote it, without suspicion of its
effect. Thereupon, the master read it, put
it into his pocket, and by virtue of the
document, demanded payment of the sum
in question. It was paid; and the triumphant
master forthwith proceeded&mdash;

The state of things, in regard to our
reading resources, was before the modern
facilities for gadding about existed; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
while those who find time lying heavy on
their hands can now steam it a hundred
miles to make a morning-call, journeying
was then both more tedious and more
expensive, seldom undertaken except as an
affair of business, or with the deliberate
purpose of a long-concerted visit; and a
good part of the day was consumed in
travelling half that distance by public conveyance.
The consequence was, that people&#8217;s
pleasures, with their duties, laid
mostly at home, or near at hand. Hence
family and friendly ties were more closely
drawn. The better feelings of our nature
were, I think, deeper, than when scattered
over a wide but thin social surface;
just as the water in a well is more concentrated,
than if diffused in the basin of
a pond. To some extent, therefore, wholesomely
isolated, besides the ordinary round
of not very formal visiting parties, there
were reading circles, for those who were
prompted by intellectual yearnings, frequented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
by young ladies and gentlemen,
married or single, at which passages from
the better class of books were read aloud
by such of the male members as felt competent
to the exercise, by turns. In fact,
taking into view the intelligence, the inexpensive
accomplishments, and the unaffected
manners of the fairly educated among
us, it has not fallen to the lot of most persons
to meet with any society more really
agreeable. St. James&#8217;s, however, and the
congregation of the successors of those
who founded the First Church, who had at
length become what was called &#8220;liberal,&#8221;
in contrast with the orthodoxy of the rest
of the town, aspired to a higher degree
of gentility and accomplishment than the
commonalty; and, in evidence that we
were not bigoted, my mother would sometimes
allow me, when a boy, and desirous
of some change, to attend service of an
afternoon, at the latter place of public worship
with some friends of the family who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
waited upon its ministrations. Of the diversions
of the common people I particularly
remember one under the curious name
of a &#8220;Joppa Jine&#8221; (join); to which I allude
from the oddity of its name, derived from
a part of the town so called by the river-side,
when several families of neighbors and
friends contributed their respective quota
of a common feast, and repaired to the
island at the mouth of the river to enjoy
a day of leisure and merriment.

In a certain class, the ancient pronunciation
of many English words was maintained,
doubtless brought by the ancestors
of New England families from &#8220;home,&#8221; and
transmitted to their descendants; such as
<i>airth</i> for earth, <i>fairm</i> for firm, <i>sartain</i> for
certain, <i>pint</i> for point, en<i>vy</i> for envy, <i>ax</i>
with the broad <i>â</i> for ask, <i>housen</i> for houses,
<i>his&#8217;n</i> and <i>her&#8217;n</i> for his and hers, <i>rare</i> for
rear; as, for instance, the horse <i>rares</i> up;
and sounding the <i>l</i> in would. Common
enough names, too, were clipped or contracted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
in English fashion. Thus, the
names of Norwood and Harwood became
Norrod in sound and Harrod in spelling;
and the name of Currier, whether with any
reference or not to the French <i>Cuir</i>, for
leather, was not long since uniformly pronounced
<i>Kiah</i>, with the long <i>&#x012B;</i>; Thurlow
was strangely transformed into <i>Thurrill</i>;
and Pierpont, often formerly spelled Pierpoint,
with entire neglect of its derivation,
was pronounced <i>Pearpint</i>, by old-fashioned
people, the first syllable approximating to
the original formation of <i>pierre</i>.
</p>
<p>
In connection with this modification of
language, I observe in a daily paper how
much a worthy old lady puzzled her minister,
for a moment, by inquiring the meaning
of &#8220;silver shiners for Diana,&#8221; in the
Bible; but a good deacon, at an evening
meeting in the chapel of their house of
worship, in our town, sadly disturbed the
gravity of the religious assembly, by reading
it <i>silver shins for Dinah</i>!

The late Mr. Edward Everett is authority (with me) for
the story, that on the occasion of the visit of Washington
to New England, in 1789, Parsons was appointed to deliver
the address of welcome, on the part of the town,
and said to his students, &#8220;Well, boys, I am to make this
address. Now, go to work and write it, and I will deliver
the best.&#8221; He chose the one prepared by Adams.

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p>
I trust it will not be thought inappropriate
to the allusion already made to our
reading circles, if I here insert a <i>jeu d&#8217;esprit</i>,
the production of one of the members,
indicating a certain forwardness in the
sphere of literary investigation, and affording
a plausible solution of a literary problem,
which had been so long shrouded in
mystery, namely, the true narrative of &#8220;Old
Grouse in the Gun-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
This is the name of the story to which
Goldsmith alludes in his comedy, &#8220;She
Stoops to Conquer.&#8221; Mr. Hardcastle, the
host of the occasion, in preparation for the
dinner he is about to give his guests,
charges his rustic servants that if he should
say a good thing at the table, they are not
to burst out laughing, as if they were a part
of the company to be entertained. Diggory,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
thereupon replies to his master,&mdash;&#8220;Then,
ecod, your worship must not tell
the story of &#8216;Ould Grouse in the Gun-room.&#8217;
I can&#8217;t help laughing at that&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;for
the soul of me. We have laughed at
that these twenty years&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&#8221;
Mr. Hardcastle admits, that this pet narrative
of his may properly be considered
an exceptional case. On the other hand,
it has uniformly foiled the researches of
critics and commentators to ascertain what
this story really was which &#8220;Squire Hardcastle,&#8221;
in the exuberance of his own enjoyment
of it, gave them the liberty to laugh
at, if they liked. It has been generally supposed,
indeed, that the story itself was, in
fact, non-existent, and that the ingenious
author of the play merely invented the title
in order to show off the uncouth peculiarities
which it was his object to display.
</p>
<p>
Now, it so happens, that the means are
not wanting for the solution of this mystery,
and in illustration of the life of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
writer and a man so interesting as Goldsmith,
I am glad to be able to clear up
the critical embarrassment. Years ago, the
writer of this article fell by chance into
the company of Miss Goldsmith, grandniece
of Mrs. Johnson, who was housekeeper
of old Mr. Featherston, of County
Kerry, Ireland. She knew the story in
question very well, and it is gratifying to
be able to verify the authenticity of the
allusion of a great poet and writer in general,
of whom Dr. Johnson has said, in
those familiar words in his epitaph, that he
touched nothing which he did not adorn,
and whose character has been very much
misunderstood, chiefly by reason of the
misrepresentations of Boswell. This parasite
of Johnson, who has given us one of
the most entertaining books of biography
ever written, was jealous not only of Goldsmith&#8217;s
literary reputation, so far as it
might rival that of his special idol, but also
of the real hold which Goldsmith, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
of his simplicity as well as his genius, had
upon the affections of the great moralist.
While he was himself admitted to the high
literary society which he frequented, on
terms of sufferance chiefly, Boswell took
every pains to disparage poor Goldsmith.
The poet, whose writings possess a charm
so seldom paralleled, it must be allowed,
gave no little occasion for depreciation, by
his want of firmness of character; and Boswell
maliciously set forth all his singularities
and weaknesses in the most ludicrous
point of view. Whoever will take pains,
however, to read his delightful &#8220;Life&#8221; by
John Forster, will find the general impressions
on the subject very materially corrected,
and will see, that, if the hard-driven
bard had many faults, he had also many
virtues, which, as Lord Bacon remarks, is
&#8220;the posy of the best characters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But to the veritable story of &#8220;Old Grouse
in the Gun-room.&#8221; It seems, according to
the narrative of Mrs. Johnson, that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
family of Mr. Featherston were seated at
the tea-table, at the close of a chilly day,
a bright fire blazing on the hearth, and the
servants, as usual, being in attendance.
On a sudden, a tremendous crash was
heard in a distant part of the ancient mansion,
followed by a succession of wails of
the most lugubrious and unearthly character,
which reverberated through the echoing
passage-ways of the house. Whatever
the cause of the sounds might be, there
was no doubt they were of the most horrifying
description. The family, consisting
of the &#8217;Squire, a maiden sister, and one or
two younger persons, jumped from their
seats in the utmost consternation, while
Patrick and the rest of the domestics
rushed from the room in a state of terror
more easily to be conceived than described,
and huddled together in the kitchen, as
far as possible from the occasion of their
fright.
</p>
<p>
Imagine a lonely country-house, a quiet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
and well-ordered family seated at their
evening meal, after dark, of a somewhat
gloomy day, the apartment imperfectly
lighted by the glowing fire, and according
to such conveniences for the purpose as
old times ordinarily afforded; the conversation,
perhaps, turning on such unexciting
topics as the weather, past, present, and
to come, or the thoughts reverting, it may
be, to such mundane topics as the expected
game of whist or backgammon,&mdash;and the
scene suddenly broken in upon by the
most startling and terrific sounds, which
seemed to result from no intelligible cause,
and for which it seemed impossible to account
by reference to any merely human
agency. The young folks, after their first
scream of terror, sat dumb, pale, and utterly
helpless.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s the Banshee!&#8221; screamed Aunt
Nelly, sinking back, in a faint, into her
chair.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s the devil, I believe,&#8221; cried the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
&#8217;Squire, who, notwithstanding age and infirmity,
retained a good deal of that original
pluck, which had formerly distinguished
him as an officer in his Majesty&#8217;s military
service. &#8220;Yes, it is the devil, I verily believe;
and there is no way but to send for
the priest, to get him out of a house that
never was troubled in this way before.
Where are those sneaking curs?&#8221; as Patrick
and the rest in a body peeped into the
room through the door they had forgotten
to shut in their flight, and too much frightened
to stay quietly anywhere. &#8220;Patrick,&#8221;
called out the &#8217;Squire, &#8220;go at once for
Father O&#8217;Flaherty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At this moment, another preternatural
yell, long-toned and of the most mournful
cadence, burst upon their ears, and the dismayed
servants fairly tumbled over each
other and sprawled and scrambled through
the passage, in their haste to get away.
The &#8217;Squire followed and ordered Patrick
forthwith to mount Sorrel and hasten for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
the priest, at the village, a mile or more
away.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;O Lord! your worship,&#8221; cried that
valiant man-of-all-work,&mdash;though aided in
the day-time by two or three assistants
from the village,&mdash;&#8220;O Lord! your worship!
only ask me anything but that&#8221;&mdash;as,
of course, on such occasions people are
ready to do all but the very thing which
the exigency demands,&mdash;&#8220;O Lord! your
worship&#8217;s honor! I couldn&#8217;t for the world
go round <i>that</i> corner of the house, to get
to the stable; but if Nancy here&mdash;now
Nancy, darlint, I know you will, honey&mdash;if
she&#8217;ll only go with me, I&#8217;ll run for his
reverence as fast as my poor legs, that&#8217;s
all of a tremble, will carry me&#8221;&mdash;shrewdly
reflecting, as did Nancy also, that the
farther they left the house behind, they
left the danger, too. This affair being
hastily arranged, as the two ready messengers
proceeded towards the door, a
quick step was heard upon the gravel, followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
by an emphatic knock, and the embodied
household fell back with renewed
trepidation; when fortunately who should
it be but Father O&#8217;Flaherty himself, who
found the &#8217;Squire, his family, and servants
all huddled together in the hall.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good-evening to you, &#8217;Squire,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;and faix, what is the matter that you all
look so pale? The holy saints forbid that
any ill luck has come to this house!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Again, rang echoing through the open
doors and empty rooms the same portentous
sound, rendered none the less terrific
that its tones were partly subdued by distance.
&#8220;Holy Father!&#8221; exclaimed the
priest, crossing himself&mdash;&#8220;what is that?
Has Satan dared to cross this blessed
threshold?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Upon this, half a dozen tongues began
to relate the circumstances of terrors only
too manifest; but Mr. Featherston silenced
them, and proposed to Father O&#8217;Flaherty
to accompany him to the investigation of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
the mystery. Accordingly they solemnly
proceeded towards the scene of alarm, the
&#8217;Squire having provided himself with a long-disused
sword which hung over his mantel-piece,
and the priest, more spiritually,
brandishing his cross, and muttering &#8220;<i>Vade
retro, Satanas!</i>&#8221; and such other exorcisms
as occurred to him on the way. The whole
body of the inmates of the mansion followed,
closely though tremulously, upon the footsteps
of the advanced guard, and, indeed,
afraid to be left behind. As they reached
the neighborhood of the door, whence the
sounds appeared to come, there was a truly
awful noise of scampering round the room
and pattering, as it were, within.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The saints defend us!&#8221; cried the priest,
falling back, as this new demonstration
was responded to by the screams of the
females, who sank to the floor, in the extremity
of their terror, when another horrible
yell sounded close at hand.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s he, I verily believe,&#8221; said the priest;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
&#8220;the holy saints be about us! It&#8217;s he, I
wager. Lord, forgive us! for I heard the
sound of his hoofs. But where&#8217;s the dog?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The dog!&#8221; cried the &#8217;Squire. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t I think of that before! Open the
door, I say, Pat, you cowardly vagabond!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At this instant, there was a tremendous
bounce against the door, which forced the
latch, and out tumbled Old Grouse, capering
among the party, who still screamed
and scattered out of his way, not yet convinced
that the Evil One was not loosed
and bodily among them.
</p>
<p>
The relieved household at length returned
to their interrupted avocations, and
Pat declared to the folks in the kitchen,
that all the while he knew it was the dog,
only he kept up the fright for the sake of
the joke. It seemed that the &#8217;Squire had
been out with his gun that day, and had
shut the big dog which accompanied him
into the gun-room, upon his return. The
dog, no doubt fatigued with his excursion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
had stretched himself out in a corner of
the room, where various articles tending to
his comfort lay disposed. He had remained,
until tired of his confinement he had risen,
and fumbling about had thrown down an
ancient heavy shield, which produced the
first cause of alarm, no less to himself than
to the household. The moon shining
through the window had attracted his attention,
and he began to bay, as dogs
sometimes will. The sudden fright, and
the distance of the gun-room from the
family apartment, served to modify the intonation,
and in his confusion of mind Mr.
Featherston failed to recognize his voice.
&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I never knew the
whelp to bay before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As time wore on, and the story had
often been told by him, it lost none of its
original features, except, perhaps, the remembrance
of his own agitation. But the
fright of the family and his domestics, the
assent of the priest to their superstitious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
fears, and the mortal terror which overwhelmed
them, when out bounded the
shaggy black monster of a dog and in an
instant was pawing them all round, in his
ecstasy of escape, and whatever else was
ludicrous in the adventure, was oftentimes
related by the &#8217;Squire, with all the aid it
could derive from a somewhat lively imagination
and considerable power of native
eloquence.
</p>
<p>
And now, if I have only invented this
story of &#8220;Old Grouse in the Gun-room,&#8221;
for the entertainment of my readers, I
have at least attached a tale, which may
be thought to have some plausibility, to a
famous title, which has run through the
world, for so many years, without any tale
at all.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p>
In a note at the end of Chapter V. of
&#8220;Waverley,&#8221; Sir Walter Scott remarks:&mdash;&#8220;These
introductory chapters have been
a good deal censured as tedious and unnecessary.
Yet there are circumstances
recorded in them which the author has
not been able to persuade himself to retract
or cancel.&#8221; So if, in giving certain loose
hints rather than sketches of characters
and manners in a very interesting town,
ardently beloved by all who have ever
had any near connection with it, during
a former generation of its inhabitants, I
should be thought to have set down too
many &#8220;unconsidered trifles,&#8221; I can only
shelter myself under the shadow of his
great name, and plead that I had not the
heart to leave them out, as they occurred
to my memory while writing; and however
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
they may lack, as they necessarily
must, the storied value of Sir Walter&#8217;s fascinating
fictions, they have at least this
merit,&mdash;that every narrative and anecdote
in these pages is a veritable fact.
</p>
<p>
I should not wonder, however, if a couple
of stories or so, which I am about to relate,
were looked upon as purely fictitious by
the philosophical reader. I do not pretend
that the facts stated were within my own
experience, only that I positively heard
them related by persons of the strictest
veracity, who were actual observers or
actors in the transactions of which they
professed to give an account. People ridicule,
nowadays, when in company, the superstitions
of earlier times; though it is
not unlikely that the nerves of some of the
boldest contemners of marvellous manifestations,
once universally accepted as true,
might still tremble, if alone and under circumstances
calculated to awaken apprehension
and to puzzle the understanding. Notwithstanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
the accepted theory, that the
very pretence of witchcraft, for example,
was exploded a hundred and fifty years
ago, and the idea of an apparition, in spite
of Dr. Johnson&#8217;s belief, and that of others
as wise and stout as he, would be scouted
as preposterous in cultivated circles, I believe
that there are many places in New
England where undoubting faith in both
superstitions still prevails, and I know that
within a third part of the period above
mentioned, very many creditable persons in
a certain place in New England accepted
the strangest occurrences of both kinds,
upon the supposed evidence of their sober
senses.

<p>
We will imagine, then, that we are sitting
in a circle around the fire-place in Uncle
Richard&#8217;s spacious kitchen, on the evening
of Christmas-day, the room lighted only by
the blazing logs upon the hearth, the glow
of which glanced along the walls and
drew brilliant reflections from the brightly-scoured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
dishes and other utensils of metal,
which stood ranged upon the shelves. We
were quite a party, and had made merry,
according to our fashion, during the day.
Uncle Richard was himself the most conspicuous
of the group. I have said that
he was well-to-do, and he was certainly
a gentleman in spirit and bearing. The
black dress which he assumed on Sundays,
and other occasions of public importance,
set off his figure well, and his white hair
gathered into a pig-tail behind and tied up
with a ribbon by some one of his daughters,
of a morning, gave him a venerable appearance,
at least in the eyes of us youngsters,
beyond what the actual number of his
years warranted. For I have observed that
those who may have seemed to us approaching
the verge of old age, in our
youth, begin to look almost like coevals
again, as we ourselves have advanced in
the stage of manhood. Aunt Judith, on
the other hand, who was a maiden lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
of a certain age, was dressed with all the
care and neatness which somewhat scanty
means enabled her to apply, and, as I am
about to produce her as a witness, I feel
it incumbent upon me to asseverate, that,
being a devoutly religious woman, I have
never met in my life with a more conscientious
and scrupulously truth-telling person.
After tea, my uncle had requested the
young people present to sing a new Christmas
Hymn, not to be found in the Prayer
Book, but the production of a devout poetical
acquaintance, in the performance of
which he joined with a bass voice of singular
compass and melody.

The conversation, at such times, is very
apt to run into story-telling, among those
who have any stores of memory, or are
possessed of inventive faculties, and often
turns upon such inexplicable incidents as
might well bewilder the imaginations of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
simple country folks. My uncle gave us
an account of a lad not long before in his
employ, who laughed at the idea of supernatural
appearances, and was indeed afraid
of nothing. &#8220;The young scamp,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;though I don&#8217;t know why I should call
him so, for he was as honest as he was
bold,&mdash;appeared so thoroughly fearless, that
it sometimes looked like mere bravado (I
am afraid he pronounced it <i>brave-ardor</i>);
and a companion who also lived with us
resolved to put his courage to the test.
Accordingly, at dusk one evening, when
Jack was about to lead the horse to the
pasture, he provided himself with a sheet,
and placed himself on one end of the crossbeam
which rested on the rather high posts
of the gate. Jack came whistling along,
leading the horse, and, opening the gate,
slipping off the halter, gave the animal a
slap with it; and as he shut the gate cocked
up his eye at the elevated figure. &#8220;And
as for you, Mr. Devil,&#8221; says he, &#8220;you may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
sit there just as long as you please.&#8221; A
decent respect for the proprieties of his
position kept the scarecrow quiet until
Jack was well on his way to the house
which was not far distant. Pretty soon
the door was burst open, and, to our alarm,
some one tumbled in upon the floor in an
agony of terror, as we soon discovered, pale
as a ghost and scarcely able to speak. As
soon as he recovered some degree of self-possession,
he could barely stutter out,&mdash;&#8220;When
Jack got out of sight&mdash;I turned to
get down&mdash;and there sat another one, on
the other post&mdash;looking just like me!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
</p>
<p>
A great deal was thereupon said about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
the power of the imagination and the effect
it was likely to have upon one who had
placed himself in such an equivocal situation,
and the terrors which, under its influence,
might naturally revert to him, who
in an excited state of his own nerves had
endeavored to inflict such terrors upon
another. Hereupon there was a general
call upon Aunt Judith, from the youngsters
present, to tell us something about reputed
witches in her younger days,&mdash;a subject
in regard to which she was said to be
able to make some remarkable statements,
though as yet we had never obtained from
her any satisfactory information about it.
She seemed a little reluctant to indulge our
curiosity.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;As to witches,&#8221; said my uncle Richard,
gravely, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Whether the denunciations
of them in Holy Writ are intended
to apply to any actually supernatural
power possessed by them, or only to the
pretence of it,&mdash;and both are mischievous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
in their effect on the popular mind,&mdash;I shall
not undertake to say. It is certain that
the poor old women who are thus stigmatized
seem to have little power to help themselves
in this world, or, if real tamperers
with the powers of darkness, any enjoyable
expectations from the other. But
this I do know, that I was riding, not many
days since, with my lawyer, a man of considerable
acuteness, though a little eccentric
at times, coming from K&mdash;&#8217;s Island,
where we had been on some business; and
as we neared the turn of the causeway to
the main road, he pulled up the chaise,
jumped out, and placing himself on a broad
flat rock by the road-side, began violently
to dance up and down and to shake his
clothes. &#8216;Good Heavens!&#8217; cried I, &#8216;are
you mad?&#8217; &#8216;Oh, no,&#8217; said he, resuming
his seat, &#8216;but my mother always told me,
that whenever I was coming away from
K&mdash;&#8217;s Island, I must stand upon that rock
and shake the witches off!&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But your story, Aunt Judith! your
story,&#8221; we all cried out, and after a little
more hesitation the good woman <i>prit la
parole</i>, as Madame de Stäel so often phrases
it in &#8220;Corinne.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;When I was a grown-up girl,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;I and my older sister, who had lost
her husband at sea, lived with my mother,
who was also a widow. We had few of
this world&#8217;s goods, but health and energy
enough to take care of ourselves. At one
time, we moved into half a house, in a decent
quarter of the town, the other part of
which was occupied by an old woman called
by the neighbors &#8216;Granny Holt.&#8217; Coming
from a street of the town at some distance,
we had heard nothing that I remember
about her; but the day had not gone by,
before it was made fully known to us by
such acquaintances as we saw, that we
had taken up our abode in the same house
with a person of a very crabbed disposition,
whom all the neighborhood looked upon as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
a witch. This was not very agreeable
news, but we tried to make the best of it.
Our house was near the river-side, and we
were surrounded by the families of those
who followed the sea, and we endeavored
to flatter ourselves with the idea, that idle
tales of marvelous things are very common
among that class of population; and that
the stories we heard were mere gossip, as
we whispered to ourselves, for fear of being
overheard through the thin partition
which divided us from the other tenant.
But, &#8216;No!&#8217; said one of our callers in a
low voice&mdash;one of the Pearse girls (a young
lady, by the way, about seventy, but Aunt
Judith was of a certain age); &#8216;I tell you
it&#8217;s as true as a sermon in the meetin&#8217;-house.
You&#8217;ll soon find out what she can
do. Why, there&#8217;s young Stout, as fine a
lad as ever walked the streets, or stood by
the helm of his vessel in a gale o&#8217; wind; and
look at him now, pale and cadaverous, and
walking round people&#8217;s gardens, on the edge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
of narrow fences where nobody but a rope-dancer,
with a pole in his hands, could
keep his balance, and a hundred more
such antics; everybody knows she bewitched
him.&#8217;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8216;But what for?&#8217; we asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8216;Oh, they had a quarrel, and pretty soon
he began to cut these capers.&#8217;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My sister Ann, the widow, however,
who had always a brave spirit, declared
that she did not care a fig for all the
witches in Christendom; but I must own
that I was very much alarmed. You may
be sure, we none of us much liked this sort
of greeting, on the first day of our entering
into our new habitation, and we prepared
to retire early, my mother, who was a truly
pious person, trusting to the only sure
defence. Upon going to my chamber, I
found there was no fastening to the door;
in fact the handle itself was quite out of
kilter, and it could not be shut tight. I
moved up to it, therefore, a chest of drawers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
putting some things on top, and thus
brought the door close. I was just about
to blow out the candle to get into bed,
when I heard a scrambling in the chimney,
and you may believe it or not, but it&#8217;s the
solemn truth&mdash;a black cat jumped from
the fire-place, ran and leaped a-top of the
things I had placed against the door, put
her paw upon the handle of it, gave me one
sidelong glance, opened the door itself and
passed out. I was too frightened for anything
but to wrap myself thoroughly in the
bedclothes, and trembling with terror, at
last fell into a troubled sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Are you sure, Aunt Judith,&#8221; said my
uncle Richard, &#8220;that the cat did not go
under the bed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I tell you, as plainly as I see you now,
I saw her open the door, look round at me
with that malicious kind of expression, go
out and shut the door behind her; and in
the morning everything I had piled up
against it was unmoved.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It must have been the ghost of a cat,
then,&#8221; said my uncle; &#8220;but did anything
else happen, afterwards?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, in a few days we had got a baking
ready and the oven heated, when the old
woman came in with an armful of wood,
threw it down on the hearth, and said she
wanted to bake. The oven was for the use
of both parts of the house; but we told her
as soon as we had got through she should
have it. She went off muttering, and when
we thought our batch was done and went
to take it out, it was burned just as black
as a coal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; said my uncle, &#8220;you let it
stay in too long, or the oven was too hot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You may laugh as much as you please,&#8221;
replied Aunt Judith, with spirit, &#8220;but I tell
you what I actually saw with my own eyes.
We did not stay longer in that house than
we could find another place; but before
we left something took place which perhaps
you&#8217;ll not find it so easy to explain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Young William Stout&#8217;s folks had been so
troubled about him, and the doctors said
they could do nothing, that they determined
to try a &#8216;project.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I may as well explain what Aunt Judith&#8217;s
modesty prevented her from doing; that a
&#8220;project&#8221; was to inclose a certain liquid
emanation of the afflicted person in a phial
tightly stopped, and to put it over the fire
in a pot to boil. Of course, as in the case
of the sympathetic remedies described by
Sir Kenelm Digby and practised by him,
as the contents of the phial boil, the witch
burns, and she is inevitably detected by
the scorching she gets and the scars it
leaves behind. It is from this circumstance,
undoubtedly, that the nursery rhyme derives
its authority,&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>
<tr><td><p>&#8220;Hinx minx, the old witch winks,<br />
&nbsp;The fat begins to fry,&#8221; etc.
</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
This is precisely the operation of the
process in question.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Accordingly,&#8221; continued Aunt Judith,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
&#8220;the Stout folks made all their preparations,
in company with some trusty neighbors;
the doors were fastened, and exactly
at twelve o&#8217;clock the &#8216;project&#8217; was begun.
Everything went on well; but, as often
happens in such cases, something was forgotten,
or the witches&#8217; master interferes;
for it seemed, after a while, that more water
was wanted, and one of the company took
the pail to go to the well for it. As he
cautiously opened the door, there to their
horror stood Granny Holt, in the darkness
of midnight! She came in grinning
and complimenting, and without expressing
surprise at finding so many persons together,
at such an unusual hour, or making
any inquiry as to the reason, she said, &#8216;one
of their folks was taken sick and seeing a
light there, she had come over to beg some
herbs.&#8217; There was the end of the <i>project</i>,
and I don&#8217;t know as it was ever tried
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Were you there, yourself?&#8221; asked Uncle
Richard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No, I can only swear to the black cat
and the burnt pies; but everybody in our
neighborhood knew all about the project
and Granny Holt&#8217;s breaking it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
We had become pretty well stirred up
by this time, but as is likely to be the case
under such circumstances, were eager for
whatever other marvel might be forthcoming;
for no matter how intelligent or incredulous
the circle of hearers may be, there is
something strangely fascinating in these
weird stories. People may affect indifference
&#8220;amidst the blazing light of the nineteenth
century;&#8221; but I think that of a dark
night, in a lonely spot, the starting up of so
familiar a creature as a white horse, for instance,
would set the strongest nerves into
perturbation, at the idea of something
ghostly. Indeed, Addison declared in his
day, that there &#8220;was not a village in England
that had not a ghost in it; the churchyards
were haunted; nor was there a peasant
who had not seen a spirit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, Aunt Judith,&#8221; said Uncle Richard,
&#8220;these wonderful things seem to have
very much gone by, in our day, or else
people, for some reason, take less notice
of them than formerly. Witches, nowadays,
are characters entirely unknown, except,&#8221;
he gallantly remarked, &#8220;for the
sometimes really inexplicable fascinations
of members of your own sex; and, except
in one singular instance, I have known of
no appearances which could not be rationally
accounted for. I have heard my father,
however, tell of one which, according
to the tradition, manifested itself, one hundred
years ago or more, upon a bridge, over
the Ipswich River, in our Essex County
town of Topsfield, and was the terror of
all the country round. He appeared in
the shape of a monstrous hog, taking his
station, at night, in the very centre of the
bridge; and those who had occasion to
cross it, on horseback or on foot, were
either fain to turn back, as he encountered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
them, bristling and snarling, or rushed by,
if their occasion demanded it, in a state of
extraordinary trepidation. At length, Parson
Capen, the worthy minister of the
town, riding up to the bridge one evening,
saw the spectre in his usual position.
Nothing daunted, in virtue of his holy office,
the good man thus accosted him:
&#8216;You that were once an angel of light, ain&#8217;t
you ashamed to appear in the shape of a
dirty swine?&#8217; This expostulation was too
much for the foul fiend, who at once jumped
over the railing of the bridge into the river,
and was no more seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Amongst others of the few guests of the
evening was a young gentleman, a member
of one of the learned professions, who was
accounted an intellectual person and was
of rather grave demeanor. Though known
to have been the author of occasional
verses which gained applause, he would
not have been thought likely to be the
subject of any extraordinary hallucination.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
He was an intimate friend of our family,
and on certain occasions of unusual excitement,
if not danger, in the midst of the
various adventures of young people, had
shown a singular firmness of nerve and
presence of mind, and was thought to be
in fact insensible to fear. He had listened
to the story of the bold lad who saw the
supposed apparition on the gate-post, and
to that of the Topsfield spectre, with
much the same interest as that which
Marmion exhibited at Sir David Lindesay&#8217;s
narrative of the appearance of the
beloved Apostle to King James in Linlithgow.
Apparently induced by a similar
irresistible impulse to that which drew
from the redoubted warrior of Scott&#8217;s fascinating
poem the rehearsal of his nocturnal
adventure, our guest volunteered a relation
quite as remarkable.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will tell you a story,&#8221; said he, &#8220;of
something unaccountable which once happened
to me, though the circumstances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
are still so vivid in my memory, that I look
back upon it with a sort of superstitious
dread, and feel a decided reluctance in appealing
to the sympathy of others, in regard
to an incident which seemed exclusively
addressed to myself and was confined
to my own sole experience.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;In my senior year at College, now as
you know, not many years since, I was
appointed by my class to prepare for delivery,
on what is called Class Day, a literary
exercise,&mdash;in fact a poem, in anticipation
of the usual Commencement performances,
and was at home, during the preceding
long vacation, making ready for this
event. The writing of poetry for public
recitation before a critical audience is a
rather exacting occupation, and my ambition
was naturally excited to do the best
in my power. Indeed, the work absorbed
all my faculties; but I preferred to write
during the still hours of the night, rather
than amidst the ordinary distractions of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
day, spending that period, usually, wandering
in the neighboring fields and woods, or
in other diversions. The season was summer,
and I was sitting one night at an open
window, committing to paper such thoughts
as occurred to me, by the light of a single
candle,&mdash;for lamps were then not very
common and gas was entirely unknown.
Outside, there was not a sound, for the
whole town was buried in profound sleep,
and our own household was in the same
state of repose. It was just on the stroke of
twelve. Our house was a very ancient one,
though I never heard that there was anything
peculiarly remarkable in its history.
Sitting thus, and thus engaged in serious,
solitary contemplation, the sudden fall of
something heavy in the garret overhead
gave me a momentary start. I could compare
it to nothing but to the effect likely to
be produced by something as solid as a
smaller description of cannon-ball, though
it afterwards appeared to have attracted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
attention of no one else in the family. Supposing
that some article of furniture had accidentally
fallen, the noise of which had
been rendered more noticeable by the perfect
stillness of the night, I pursued my occupation,
until I felt disposed for sleep. On
the following night, while engaged in the
same way, and at the same midnight hour,
came the same heavy, sharp, distinct thud
upon the floor directly above my head. I
was disposed to philosophize on the subject,
and, though the coincidence was certainly
peculiar, I still conceived that this unusual
sound, at such an unusual hour, might be
attributed to some natural cause. Perhaps,
a heavy cat might have jumped down from
beams above, on both occasions, and the
noise was magnified by the otherwise unbroken
stillness, though so far as I remember
we kept no such cat of our own. I am
sure that the idea of anything supernatural
scarcely occurred to me, or was dismissed
with derision. Nevertheless, the circumstances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
were peculiar enough to induce
me to make a thorough examination of
the garret on the following morning, and I
was struck by the fact, that it was perfectly
bare of any article of furniture above my
chamber, or in the neighborhood of that
part of the attic, which could have fallen.
I was naturally a good deal perplexed at
an occurrence for which there seemed no
rational means of accounting, but I kept
my own counsel. On the third night, at
the same hour, when the clear bell from
the steeple of a meeting-house not far distant
had just tolled twelve, came the same
sudden, single, distinct sound of a fall on
the floor, directly over my head. I will not
say as Marmion did, on the occasion above
referred to,&mdash;

<p>
&#8220;On the contrary, though not a little disturbed
by incidents so unaccountable, and
rendered by the interruption quite unfit to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
pursue my occupation further, I deliberately
undressed, said my prayers, put out my
candle, and went to bed. It was a bright
starlight night, and the two windows of
my chamber made objects within indistinctly
visible. No sooner had I laid my
head upon the pillow, than through a door
at the foot of my bed appeared a slowly
moving figure, turning the corner of the
bed and approaching the side of it upon
which I lay. I could distinctly see its outlines,
and it seemed to me apparelled like a
monk, with a hood drawn over its features,
and long trailing garments. As Eliphaz
the Temanite, under similar circumstances,
has related,&mdash;&#8216;the hair of my flesh stood
up.&#8217; But I did not quite lose my self-possession.
As the figure came nearer, I
instantly threw off the bedclothes and
jumped towards it into the middle of the
room,&mdash;and it was gone! Though startled
enough at so strange an occurrence, I reflected
that it must be an illusion produced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
by some casual disorder of the natural
faculties, and returned to bed and slept as
usual until morning. But the next day I
was much more disturbed in recalling the
several circumstances of this extraordinary
visitation. The repeated previous heavy
blows upon the floor, and their apparent
consummation in the vision I supposed
myself to have seen, made me, as Othello
says, &#8216;perplexed in the extreme.&#8217; On that
day I told my mother the story; she laughed
at the idea of supernatural appearances,
perhaps to quiet her son&#8217;s emotion; but
she said she was afraid of no ghosts, proposed
an exchange of chambers, and this
accommodation at once took place. But
though I finished and delivered the poem
in question, I continued to muse by myself
upon what had occurred, unwilling to speak
to any one about it. It was many months
before I recovered from the shock to my
nervous system. Reflecting upon it at
the time, again I summoned whatever philosophy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
I had at command, as well as I
could. I conceived that possibly in the excitement
of verse-writing, in the silence of
the night, some tenseness had affected the
drum of my ear; that hearing, or imagining
that I heard some unusual sound, amid
the perfect stillness around me, a continuous
disordered state of physical functions
had produced a similar effect at a correspondent
hour; and that this experience
not unnaturally culminated in the spectral
visitation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
We heard the story in terror, and put
little faith in the theory of explanation.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But,&#8221; said my uncle Richard, himself a
good deal amazed at the narrative, &#8220;did
anything happen afterwards, to account for
what you have told us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nothing whatever,&#8221; replied our friend.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Did you ever sleep in that chamber
again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, some years afterwards. It so happened
that during several weeks in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
summer, our whole family except myself,
was away. My mother was in close attendance
upon sick members of my sister&#8217;s
family<ins class="trnote" title="?">.</ins> My brothers were at sea, and even
our ordinary servant was dismissed for the
occasion. When the time for rest arrived,
it was my habit to let myself into the house,
to proceed to the same chamber, usually
without a light, and go to bed. One night,
putting my hand upon the pillow, I felt
something soft and started back, but again
reaching forward, the object proved to be a
dove that had flown into the open window,
and securing it without difficulty I gave
that symbol of innocence immediate release.
Perhaps, it was my former visitant
in a less forbidding form. But this, as well
as the other, passed into the course of
ordinary events.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I need not say, that we had listened to
this extraordinary narrative with rapt attention
and in breathless silence. Our
friend had told his story with emotion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
certainly, but still with serious deliberation,
and exhibiting no undue signs of excitement.
No one seemed disposed to make
any observation upon it, and indeed most of
the company were utterly incapable of the
effort of speech. In a few moments, he remarked
that he would quote to us a brief
passage from Dante&#8217;s great poem which
was applicable to the subject, and did so
as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>
<tr><td><p>...&nbsp;&#8220;Now, O reader! mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if my tale thou slowly shalt receive,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I, who saw it, scarcely can believe.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
&#8220;But, Uncle Richard,&#8221; was now the cry,
&#8220;you said you had once seen an apparition,
or something like one; please tell us
all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I certainly saw something strange,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;on more than one occasion, which
has never yet been accounted for; and I
suppose it is now too late to expect it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
If it was really a matter of concert and
collusion, the motive for it has never
been discovered. You remember the open
space in town, in front of the Reverend
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s meeting-house. Your house, as
you know, Jemmie,&#8221; addressing me, &#8220;looks
directly up the street towards this square,
and to the somewhat old-fashioned mansion
opposite the meeting-house. On one
side of the square was a small dwelling,
occupied by several distant relatives of
ours; Aunt Midkiff (Metcalf), Aunt Foggison
(Ferguson, so called), and her sister,
Miss Samples (Mrs. Semple), with the
daughter of our Aunt Foggison, Mrs. Lane,
and her only child. You remember, sister,&#8221;
addressing my mother, &#8220;that you have
told me, that one night, after you had gone
to bed, your lamented husband stood at the
window looking up the street towards the
old house above, of which he had a complete
view. Upon your asking what detained
him, he called you up, and it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
evident to you both that one chamber of
the house was in a light blaze. Persons
appeared to be moving rapidly around it,
and, as it were, pulling down the curtains
of the bed, which looked as if on fire.
After a little time the appearance gradually
ceased, and your husband remarking that
he would inquire in the morning of his
neighbor, a highly respectable lawyer, who
occupied the house, what was the cause of
the extraordinary spectacle of the night
before, he also retired. But upon putting
the question to his acquaintance on the
following morning, he seemed astonished,
and utterly denied that anything unusual
had taken place in the chamber, which was
the one occupied by himself and his wife,
or that they had been at all disturbed during
the night.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now all this,&#8221; continued my uncle, &#8220;is
quite consistent with the supposition, that
this gentleman may have had some secret
motive for concealing the fact of a threatened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
conflagration, pretty sure, if known,
to become the town talk and perhaps to expose
him to inconvenient inquiries; and
though a strictly moral and religious man,
he may have thought that the circumstances
warranted a direct denial of the
matter, seeing it was, as it turned out, an
affair of purely domestic concern.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
My mother, I thought, looked at my
uncle a little anxiously, and seemed about
to make a movement for our departure; but
we urged him to tell us to what strange
thing he had referred, and why he had so
particularly described the situation and
characteristics of this square, as if there
were something more in relation to it which
it might interest us to know; for you may
be sure our mother had never mentioned
to us children anything likely to alarm us.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; said he, at last &#8220;that something,
which really did happen in front of
the house I have spoken of, will startle
you young folks, and perhaps it is foolish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
to relate it, as you seem already quite excited
enough; but I will premise by saying,
that I will only tell you what I saw myself,
or heard from those upon whose word
I could implicitly rely; and, moreover, that
I do not believe in ghosts, however singular
the facts in question may appear. Of
course, you know, sister,&#8221; addressing my
mother, &#8220;my calls at your house were
sometimes in the evening, after attending
the market or to other business during the
day. It was during one of your husband&#8217;s
absences at sea, that we were sitting around
the fire of a wintry night, when a lively
neighbor, a lady who took much interest in
whatever was going on, came in evidently
in a state of agitation, and taking her seat,
with very brief greeting, broke out with
the exclamation, &#8216;There he is again!&#8217; I
did not understand what this meant, but
it was soon explained to us that, for a
week or ten days past, some person, or
figure, or whatever it might be, had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
observed walking fore and aft, in front of the
house opposite the meeting-house, at a
certain hour of the evening, and though
many had passed, no one had recognized
him, nor did he take any notice whatever
of any one whom he met. He was said to
wear a pea-jacket buttoned to the chin, and
a glazed hat, as if prepared for any kind
of weather; or, as the gossips afterwards
said, indicating the fact that he was the
forerunner of the loss of not a few masters
of vessels residing in the neighborhood,
who perished at sea during the storms of
that season. I took my hat and went out
to see if I could discover anything uncommon.
It was a moonlight night, with a light
fall of snow upon the ground. As I passed
up the short street to the square, Aunt
Foggison&#8217;s chamber window was thrown
open, and her daughter&#8217;s voice was plainly
heard berating the supposed spectral night-walker.
&#8216;What are you doing there, you
good-for-nothing scamp, you?&#8217; cried she, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
a voice that must have reached any mortal
ears; &#8216;why don&#8217;t you go home to your family,
if you&#8217;ve got any family, or wherever
else you belong, instead of stalking up and
down here, frightening honest folks out of
their senses?&#8217; Overcome perhaps by the
vigor of her expostulation, the window was
shut down with a slam. As I advanced,
though I certainly had a full view of a
human-looking figure upon its round and
at no great distance either, and my senses
had been confirmed by the objurgations addressed
to it by our worthy relative, when
I actually reached the ground of his perambulations,
prepared to seize a single man
by the collar and learn what he was about,
it is certain that he was no longer visible.
I returned to the house and made report of
my unsuccessful doings, and unhitched my
horse and drove home. I learned, a few
days afterwards, that the figure regularly
appeared, giving one sign of vitality by a
regular tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
frozen ground, so far as any one was disposed
to listen, and spreading consternation
throughout the vicinity. The affair at
length became unendurable. Women were
afraid to go into the street, and, for that,
a good many men too, and it was really so
serious, that, as I learned, it was resolved to
form what is called, I believe, a cordon, and
gradually approaching the place simultaneously
from every avenue, so to inclose him
that escape would be impossible. Being
much acquainted with the people of
that part of the town, I was invited to join
the company, and accordingly drove in seasonably
for the purpose. Certainly, most
sober people believed the whole was but
some trick, which it only needed reasonable
pains to discover and defeat. The mysterious
figure, it seemed, continued to walk,
ignorant of or indifferent to our devices.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There were three main avenues, by
streets, to the premises, together with a
narrow passage way leading from one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
streets to another. At the appointed hour
we duly assembled on our several stations.
Our director was &#8216;a rude and boisterous
captain of the sea&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;(for Uncle Richard
could sometimes be poetical, at least in the
way of quoting Shakespeare). &#8220;It had been
arranged by him that, being on our posts,
at a fixed moment, we should move rapidly
up the several avenues and so join forces
as to form a circle inclosing the open
space, and gradually contracting our company,
if the rogue was then within our
compass we should have him sure. The
arrangement had been made in profound
secrecy, and if any there were traitors, I
was not aware of it. Sure enough there
was our guest on his usual stroll. As our
circle speedily drew in, and just as hands
were stretched out to seize him&mdash;presto,
as the jugglers say&mdash;he was gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;By the jumping gingerbread!&#8221; exclaimed
Thurlow, our uncle&#8217;s hired man,
springing from his chair by the wall, outside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
of our family party,&mdash;seeing this was
Christmas night.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh dear sus!&#8221; cried Sally Bannocks,
our own particular help of many years,
from the like position.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Our detective band,&#8221; resumed my uncle,
&#8220;looked at one another in amazement,
and after some hard swearing from a few of
the roughest, and the exchange of a hasty
&#8216;good-night,&#8217; dispersed, as far as convenient
in companies of two or three, and departed,
a good deal disconcerted, to their several
places of abode. The same experiment was
tried on two or three other occasions, as I
was informed by friends, with no better
success. Spectre or not, he always found
means to elude them; and there were always
those who, having no other means of
accounting for his evasion, insisted upon it
that he must have had confederates among
those who sought to arrest him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Could he not have escaped slyly into
the house?&#8221; asked some incredulous inquirer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;That was hardly likely, with so many
eyes upon him. Besides there was nobody
there but women and children, excessively
alarmed themselves, the husband, Captain
Y&mdash;&mdash;, being at sea, and one of those who
was afterwards known to have been lost
with all his crew, upon nearing our dangerous
coast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But why did not the city government
make a piece of work of putting an end to
such a scandal?&#8221; inquired a doubter in
spectral visitations.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, I suspect a whole body of police
could do little towards capturing an actual
ghost; and then, too, there was at that time
no city and no such force. Our town government
consisted of mostly ancient citizens,
and three or four constables, all of
whom, probably, preferred to remain quietly
and comfortably at home, instead of venturing
out into the wintry night air, to hunt up
ghosts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t somebody try the effect of
a bullet?&#8221; inquired another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, shooting was a rather violent
remedy; and as for firing at a ghost, I believe
every one was afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it strange, considering that he
must have had some particular object in
haunting that spot, and was likely, therefore,
to be found out by some of the neighborhood
by his face, or dress, or figure, or
gait, or in some way or other, if a real person,
that he never was recognized?&#8221; asked
another of our evening guests.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It was strange enough,&#8221; said my uncle;
&#8220;but few, if any, got very near him, and
they perhaps, casual passers-by, who paid
no attention to the fact. As for him, he
only walked steadily backward and forward,
turning neither to the right nor to
the left, except at each end of his beat; replying
to no interrogatories, and appearing
utterly unconscious of any epithets or railings
which from a distance were hurled
at him. Only one man ever professed to
have seen his face.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Who was that, uncle?&#8221; we all eagerly
exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Late one stormy night, when the snow
was falling fast,&#8221; continued my uncle,&mdash;&#8220;and
one would suppose that any reasonable
creature of flesh and blood would wish
to be safely housed,&mdash;an hostler named
Dobbin, who had charge of a stable at
one end of the street, was trudging home,
swinging a lantern in his hand, to the small
house in which he lived, at a little distance
beyond the now pretty notorious &#8216;Ghost&#8217;s
Walk.&#8217; As he approached the spot, there,
to be sure, was the object of terror,
taking his usual exercise. &#8216;Now,&#8217; as
Dobbin told the story, &#8216;thinks I to myself,
I&#8217;ll play you a trick, mister, and find out
who you are, if I can. So, jest slyly unfastening
the door of the lantern, as I met
him, I flung the door wide open and held
it up to his face, and I says, says I, &#8220;A
stormy night, friend.&#8221; I thought I should
know him, and guess I should if ever I do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
see him again, which I don&#8217;t want to, I tell
<i>you</i>; and may I hope to die, if ever I saw
that face before. He looked pale, and his
eyes, as he fixed &#8217;em on me, had what I call
a sort of a stony glare. He never opened
his mouth, but just looked. It was only
a glance, as it were, for I never was so
frightened in my life, and jest dropped
lantern and scampered away home as fast
as my legs could carry me.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Lud-a-massy!&#8221; screamed Sally Bannocks,
on the verge of hysterics,&mdash;and
some of the rest of us were not far from that
condition. We were mostly on our feet,
and as my mother insisted upon our bidding
&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; Uncle Richard proposed,
after a further trial of his capital
cider, to harness his horse and drive us
home in his covered wagon. But it was a
fine night and, though getting rather late,
we concluded that it would do us more
good to take the air, in the mile or two of
the walk to town. In the course of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
preparations for departure, and in answer to
a variety of questions, our uncle informed
us, that the mystery was never cleared up,
nor the trick, if trick it were, ever discovered.
As to the tale of such a person as
Dobbin, we might place what reliance upon
it we saw fit; and though the motive
seemed certainly difficult to see, it might
have been, after all, a well-contrived piece
of deception, to be sure, a very laborious
and unaccountable one, concealed by the
collusion of parties in the secret. How
long the ghost continued to walk he did
not know; but it finally disappeared, and
the house had been inhabited by respectable
people ever since, who had suffered no
disturbance.
</p>
<p>
We reached home after a brisk walk, crossing
rapidly&mdash;and with now and then a furtive
look&mdash;the very premises so haunted
in other days, and &#8220;Thanks be to Praise!&#8221;
ejaculated Sally Bannocks, as we entered
and closed the door. The house was cold,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
after having been shut up all day. We
quickly separated to our several chambers,
and as I laid my head upon the pillow and
was soon sound asleep, I too, murmured
to myself, &#8220;Thanks be to Praise!&#8221;

Jack&#8217;s composure has a parallel in that of an old-time
Scottish clergyman, as the story is told by Dean
Ramsay. On returning home late from a dinner abroad
his way led through the churchyard, and some mischievous
fellows thought to frighten him. One of them came
up to him dressed as a ghost, but the minister coolly
inquired, &#8220;Weel, maister Ghaist, is this a general rising,

<hr class='mini' />

<p>
The following papers, marked I., II., III. are
copies of those discovered among family documents
in the house of Mr. H. W. S. Cleveland,
of Salem, Massachusetts, several years ago.
They were communicated by him to the late Mr.
Henry Lunt, formerly a merchant of Boston,
father of the late highly distinguished Rev. Dr.
William Parsons Lunt, who died, much lamented,
while on his travels, at Akaba, in Arabia. How
these documents came to be deposited in Salem,
it is not easy to say. It is probable, however,
that copies were brought over by the &#8220;Mary and
John,&#8221; or the &#8220;Elizabeth and Dorcas,&#8221; which
appear to have wintered in Boston, after their
arrival, the passengers, or such of them as saw
fit and were permitted, proceeding to Ipswich,
the following year (1634) and thence to the plantation
which they called Newbury. It is likely,
therefore, that the papers which concerned the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
passengers of those vessels might be taken to
Salem, perhaps during Governor Endicott&#8217;s administration,
and placed in the hands of some
official person at that place, so as to be more accessible
to the home of the people in question,
instead of being retained at Boston, the journey
to which from Newbury was in those days a
long and tedious one, to be made on foot through
the wilderness.
</p>
<p>
To many persons the abstract of the Charter
of Charles I., which is a very liberal one, can
hardly fail to be interesting. The Orders in
Council, referred to in the text, are still more
so; while the list of passengers by the &#8220;Mary
and John&#8221; comprises many names still to be
found in Newbury. Many more familiar names
will be found among those of the company
which came by the &#8220;Elizabeth and Dorcas.&#8221;
It will be seen that in the list given are the
names of Thomas Parker, an eminent divine,
and of James Noyes, his nephew; the first the
long respected pastor of the church and the
other the &#8220;teacher&#8221; at Newbury.

Whereas by a Warr<sup>t</sup>. bearing date 22nd of
this Present, the sev&#8217;all ships following bound

several Particulars given them in charge to be
performed in their said voyage, amongst which
the said masters were to enter into several
Bonds of One Hundred Pounds a piece to His

In regard to the costume which prevailed,
among persons of wealth and standing in New
England, within a century, I quote a descriptive
passage from a history of Newburyport, by
Mrs. E. V. Smith, published in 1854, as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
&#8220;With the incoming of the nineteenth century,
garments more in conformity with present
fashions took precedence of three-cornered hats,
long coats with immense pocket-folds and cuffs,
but without collars, in which the men of the
eighteenth century prided themselves; with their
buttons of pure silver, or plated, of the size of
a half-dollar, presenting a great superfluity of
coat and waistcoat when contrasted with the
short nether garments, ycleped &#8220;breeches,&#8221; or
&#8220;small-clothes,&#8221; which reached only to the knee,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
being there fastened with large (?) silver buckles,
which ornament was also used in fastening the
straps of shoes. The gentlemen quite equalled
the ladies at this period in the amount of finery,
and the brilliancy of colors in which they indulged.
A light blue coat with large fancy buttons,
a white satin embroidered waistcoat, red
velvet breeches, silk stockings, and buckled
shoes, with a neckcloth, or scarf, of finely embroidered
cambric, or figured stuff, the ends
hanging loose, the better to show the work, and
liberal bosom and wrist ruffles (the latter usually
fastened with gold or silver buckles), were
usually considered a proper evening dress for
a gentleman of any pretension to fashion. The
clergy and many other gentlemen commonly
wore black silk stockings, and others contented
themselves with gray woollen. The boots had
a broad fold of white leather turned over the
top, with tassels dangling from either side. The
clergy frequently wore silk or stuff gowns and
powdered wigs. The ladies usually wore black
silk or satin bonnets, long-waisted and narrow-skirted
dresses for the street, with long tight
sleeves, and in the house, sleeves reaching to
the elbow, finished with an immensely broad
frill; high-heeled shoes, and always, when in full
dress, carried a profusely ornamented fan. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
excessively long waists, toward the close of this
period, were exchanged for extremely short ones;
so short, that the belt or waist was inhumanly
contrived to come at the broadest part of the
chest. But no fashion of dress was so permanent
as other customs clinging to particular
eras. Anciently, as now, fashions were changed
more or less extensively every ten years, though
certain broad characteristics remained long
enough to give specific character to the costuming
of the eighteenth century.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The writer is accurate enough, no doubt, in
her general description; but what lady could
give an entirely correct account of a gentleman&#8217;s
attire? Knee-buckles, for instance, were
almost necessarily small, instead of &#8220;large&#8221;;
it may be questioned whether top-boots were
ever decorated with tassels, a single article of
that sort often hanging at the front of a different
kind of high boot, worn long after the beginning
of the present century; and as to the
silk gowns of clergymen, it is but a very few
years since they began to be disused in the
pulpit by Presbyterian and Congregational ministers.
About forty years before the present
period, many gentlemen wore dresses of the cut
described by Mrs. Smith, though of a more subdued
color,&mdash;black, blue, or drab. Not long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
after the beginning of the present century, a
chief magistrate of Massachusetts, Gov. Gore,
made a sort of progress through the State, in
imposing style. His elegant, open carriage was
drawn by four handsome and spirited horses,
and he was attended by his aids and several
outriders. The governor was a gentleman of
fine personal appearance, and was attired in the
highest style of contemporary civil costume,
with his white hair gathered behind into a satin
bag, and his aids were in undress military
costume. He was a &#8220;Federalist,&#8221; and this
demonstration cost him his election the next
time; for, though a man of brilliant ability and
high personal character, he served but one
year. At a date fifteen years later, I saw the
&#8220;Democratic&#8221; governor of Massachusetts, Mr.
Eustis, in attendance upon the Commencement
exercises, at Harvard College, dressed much in
the fashion of half a century earlier; namely,
coat and waistcoat with broad flaps, small-clothes,
ruffles at his bosom and wrists, a cocked
hat of the old style, and a steel-hilted rapier at
his side. Ten years afterwards, one of the best
governors the Commonwealth has ever had, Mr.
Lincoln, who served the State in this capacity
for nine several terms, wore also a distinguishing
costume, but more conformable to modern fashions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
About the ruffles to his shirt-bosom I am
sure, and feel much confidence, from memory,
in regard to black small-clothes and black silk
stockings, and his hat was always decorated
with a black cockade. Nowadays a governor&#8217;s
appearance scarcely distinguishes him from any
ordinary person in the crowd.
</p>
<p>
The cocked hats, however, and much of the
costume of the eighteenth century, continued
to be worn by the survivors of Revolutionary
officers and some others, during the first quarter
of the present century and afterwards.

The subjoined interesting sketch of an ancient
dwelling-house and of a family which has
inhabited it for several generations, was furnished
by a distinguished friend, Thomas Coffin
Amory, Esq., of Boston, who traces his ancestry
on the maternal side to the family in question.
Nor, in producing this highly interesting sketch,
could I overlook Joshua Coffin, the historian of
Newbury and a resident of that town, from the
originally extensive territory of which various
adjacent towns were eventually formed. He
was possessed of many amiable qualities and
inspired by the true antiquarian spirit, and laboriously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
pored among the not very carefully kept
early records of the original settlement, and
brought much out of chaos well calculated to
illustrate its former history. Mr. Amory has,
on various occasions, shown the spirit of a careful
historical student and of an intelligent and
zealous antiquary. His recent contributions to
that excellent periodical, &#8220;The New England
Historical and Genealogical Register,&#8221; which
has become of inestimable value, as a collection
of facts illustrative of early New England history
and biography, have given great pleasure to multitudes
of readers,&mdash;especially his vivid and
graphic descriptions of certain ancient and storied
mansions in Boston and Cambridge, and
of their former inhabitants. Let us hope that
researches of such abundant interest and value
will soon claim and gain a still larger share of
the public attention in a collected form.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In your reminiscences of
Newburyport you must not forget Joshua Coffin
its historian,&mdash;one of the best of men, whom
no one knew but to love. I see him now as
he came to visit me several years ago, when he
was representing his native town in the General
Court, a fresh, hale, cheery gentleman, full of
pleasant anecdotes relating to the past. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
owned and occupied the Coffin mansion, which
had been the abode of seven generations of his
family and name. Out of its portals had issued
numberless admirable men and women, and
from among the former, a large share of college
graduates, at Harvard and other New England
colleges, of lawyers, clergy, and soldiers, to do
good service in their day and generation.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
At his suggestion, I visited this ancient dwelling
which was erected about 1649, by Mr. Somerby,
the widow of whose progenitor Tristram
Coffin, Jr., married. This Tristram was the eldest
son of another Tristram, first of the race in
America, who not many years before, in 1642,
came over from Brixton, near Plymouth, in Devonshire,
bringing with him his mother, and two
sisters,&mdash;Eunice who married William Butler,
and Mary who became the wife of Alexander
Adams, of Boston. He brought with him also
several sons and daughters, to whom were added
others born to him on this side the ocean. His
family in the home country had shown the same
tenacity and steadfastness, exemplified by their
long continued residence at Newburyport; for
at Alwington and Portledge in Devon, they had
flourished, if not from the flood, from periods
very remote; for according to the historical statement,
the Normans when they came over in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
eleventh century found them there, and left
them unmolested; and there still dwell their descendants
in the female line, who have assumed
their appellation of Pine Coffin, one of the house
of Pine having married the heiress of the family
estates.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
Tristram the elder, and his sons James and
Stephen, were among the nine who purchased
the island of Nantucket from the Earl of Stirling
in 1659, and went there to dwell. Their
descendants have ever since been respectable
and greatly multiplied, and not only on that
island but all over the country, having since
been estimated by thousands if not tens of thousands.
Their usual average of children has
been half a score, and from their numerous
progeny and great longevity, we may judge
what vigor was in the race. One of them, William,
son of Nathaniel, son of James, cruised
over many seas, as commander of a merchantman,
and becoming interested in a Boston
maiden, Ann Holmes, settled about 1720 in the
provincial capital, where among other offices he
filled with credit to himself and his name was
that for many years of warden of Trinity Church.
He died before the Revolution, leaving many
children; most of his sons at that period becoming
refugee loyalists, they and their descendants
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
taking high rank in the British military and
naval service. John, son of Nathaniel, was a distinguished
officer in the Carolinas, and afterwards
became Major-general. His brother, Sir
Isaac, early became distinguished on the ocean,
was an Admiral, Member of Parliament, and
created a Baronet, which latter rank was also
bestowed on Thomas Astor, son of William, the
eldest son of the warden. Several others of
the name and blood then and since have filled
with distinction posts of honor and respectability
in the civil service of the mother country
at home, in Canada, and in India.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
But this is a digression. The only connection
of the Nantucket branch with Newbury is
that old Tristram lived there for a brief period,
before repairing to his island home, and his
son (the younger of the name of Tristram, the
family name of a grandmother) and his posterity
occupied the old mansion down through
seven or eight generations, and still dwell beneath
its roof. At the time of its erection the
edifice must have been among the most elegant,
as its good state of preservation proves it to
have been one of the most substantial of its
day, when the notion, prevailing in England,
that oak was the most suitable material of the
forest for dwellings, governed in their choice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
with less reason, our American planters. It
was built in the mode common to the period,
round a vast brick chimney-stack, ten or twelve
feet square. The principal apartment, now divided
into two, possessed, as did also the kitchen,
one of those spacious fireplaces which are
the marvel and envy of these degenerate days,
when a hole in the carpet has superseded in
many households the family hearth. It is
pleasant to think of the groups that in the olden
time clustered around them; charming people,
whom we know by tradition, and who are remembered
by many associations.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
The house possesses various other apartments
of size and pretension, and has answered
well the needs of the successive generations
that have occupied it, not only as a spacious
and commodious abode, but one sufficiently
elegant to satisfy the advancing standards of
taste and refinement. Among the marked features
of the building are several small casements,
lighting closets and staircases, which give
variety to the monotonous symmetry of windows
all of a size, one on top of another, and where
all the openings for egress or light are in
straight lines and of equal dimensions. It is
many years since my visit, and I hope you will
see it, for much that was peculiar, and made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
weird impression at the time, has passed out of
mind. If the trickles in my own veins do not
mislead, the present proprietors will be glad to
have pleasure afforded to the reading community,
even by this inadequate description of a
house which has such claims to be known, if, as
you intimate, you purpose to place this account
of it in your Appendix. They will not consider
it a liberty if I repeat what some one not long
since told me of an interesting relic of the past
discovered on its walls, a statement which might
be related almost in the same words of the
house of MacPhædrics at Portsmouth.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
Not many years since it was concluded to
repaper the hall, the walls of which were
covered with several thicknesses of paper which
had from generation to generation been pasted
one upon another. It was thought best to remove
them all, and when a large party of young
people, home for the holidays, were gathered
for a dull week of weather under its roof, they
determined to amuse themselves by stripping
off the various layers of previous decorations,
preparatory to the new one intended to take
their place. Underneath them all was discovered,
painted on the wall, artistic designs of
figures and foliage, such as were common in
the days of the Stuarts. All antiquarians are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
familiar with the similar discoveries at Portsmouth,
to which allusion has been made.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
There are not many houses in America which
have been so long owned and occupied by the
same name. The old brick mansion near
Portsmouth, of the Weeks family, the Curtis
house at Boston Highlands, Fairbanks at Dedham,
Pickering at Salem, were contemporaries
in the period of the construction, and have descended
from sire to son as has this of the
Coffins.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 0.9em; margin-left:4em; margin-right:4%'>
The house is pleasantly placed, and commands
fine views from its windows. Even in
winter it must be, if not a cheerful, an interesting
abode to dwell in. In duller days, when
skies are leaden, and the more you see around
you the less you like it, its dreamy look of age
and strangeness within and without may have
a somewhat depressing influence. The aches
and agonies of so many generations may gain
an ascendancy over the exuberant joys that
made their life worth living. It would sometimes
seem that if fondness for the supernatural must
be indulged, an old edifice like this would prove
a haunt more attractive, and certainly more appropriate,
for ghost and apparition than any
school-room, however noted for its spells. Yet
notwithstanding some lugubrious associations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
connected with the family patronymic, phantoms
would have to tread softly and whisper
low if they invaded its precincts; for the vigorous
vitality of its occupants and their cheery
tones, if up to the traditional standard of their
race, would exorcise the very king of spectres
himself, should he venture to stalk about at the
noonday, or revisit the glimpses of the moon
in its ancient chambers.

I might have mentioned, as one of the amusements
of childhood, the throwing of a piece of
paper upon the embers of our wood-fire, for we
had no coal in those days, and watching the
gradual extinguishment of the sparks, likening
it to a congregation entering the meeting-house.
&#8220;There they go in,&#8221; we would say. &#8220;There&#8217;s
the minister;&#8221; and as the final spark disappeared,&mdash;&#8220;Now,
the sexton has gone in and
shut the door.&#8221; I speak of this only as a curious
illustration of English ways traditionally surviving
in New England. Thus Cowper tells us:&mdash;

On my occasional visit to Boston, I usually
put up at the Eastern Stage House, perhaps
because it was there that the stage-coach by
which I arrived at the city discharged its passengers.
It was an old fashioned establishment,
which but for the absence of galleries,
might remind one of the famous Tabard Inn,
from which Chaucer&#8217;s pilgrims set out. For its
capacious yard, in which the passengers alighted,
and where they remounted for their homeward
journey, was approached through a narrow cross
street, and in its ample stables the stage-horses
took their rest and refreshment. The front entrance
to the tavern was under an archway on
Ann street, loyally named for the old queen;
for which title was not long ago senselessly substituted
the unsuggestive appellation of North
street. It has long since given place to more
modern edifices. It was a comfortable place
of temporary residence, and in illustration of
former manners I remember one practice which
I have never seen elsewhere. At the plate
of each guest, at dinner, was placed a small decanter
of brandy, holding I suppose half-a-pint
of that liquor, and for which no extra charge
appeared in the bill, which account itself was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
moderate enough compared with the inordinate
hotel reckonings of the present day.

In small matters, as well as in great, history
repeats itself. Thus, the anachronic emotion
of Miss &mdash;&mdash; (on page <a href="#LN_hysterical_girl">17</a>) finds its parallel in
&#8220;Facetiæ Poggii,&#8221; written at Florence, in the
year 1450, of which the following story is
one:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Cyriac of Ancona, a wordy man and much
given to talk, was once deploring in our presence
the fall and ruin of the Roman empire,
and seemed to be vehemently grieved at it.
Then Anthony Lusco, a most learned man, who
also stood by, said, jeering at the silly grief of
the fellow, &#8216;He is very like a man of Milan,
who, hearing on a feast day one of the race
of minstrels, who are wont to sing the deeds
of departed heroes to the people, reciting
the death of Roland, who was slain about
seven hundred years before in battle, fell at
once a-weeping bitterly, and when he got home
to his wife, and she saw him sad and sighing,
and asked what was the matter, &#8220;Alas! alas!
wife,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we are as good as dead and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
gone.&#8221; &#8220;Why, man,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;what
dreadful thing has befallen you? Take comfort
and come to supper.&#8221; But he, when he
went on sobbing and sighing, and would take
no food, and his wife pressed him to tell the
cause of his woe, at last said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know
the bad news I have heard to-day?&#8221; &#8220;What?&#8221;
asked the wife. &#8220;Roland is dead, who alone
was the safeguard of Christendom.&#8221; On which
his wife tried to soothe the silly grief of her
husband, and yet, with all her tenderness, could
scarce get him to sit down to meat.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
</p>
<p>
The effect of the ballad, however, upon the
worthy man of Milan reminds one of the historical
incident, recording the effect of song,
celebrated anew in one of the stanzas of Childe
Harold:&mdash;
</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='pts'>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fettered thousands felt the yoke of war,<br />

Pearson, and Toppan, were natives of
Newbury.

I could hardly dismiss this volume from my
hands without some reference to the means of
public information furnished by the newspapers
of the town. Of these, there have been, since
&#8220;The Essex Journal,&#8221; soon afterwards merged
in &#8220;The Impartial Herald,&#8221; and first published
in 1773, between thirty and forty attempts to
establish newspapers; but the &#8220;Herald,&#8221; the
successor of those before-named, for many
years conducted as a semi-weekly journal, and
since the year 1832 as a daily paper, has alone
steadily maintained its ground. It has always
been distinguished for the editorial ability displayed
in its columns, and for a care bestowed
upon its several departments, which gave it a
high reputation, scarcely surpassed by that of
leading journals in our larger cities.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Essex Journal&#8221; was begun by Isaiah
Thomas, who in the course of a year sold his
interest in it to Ezra Lunt; and he, after two
years, obeying another call to public service,
sold it to John Mycall. The first of these
began life in the humblest condition, without
schooling of any kind, it is alleged; taught
himself to read and write, and after a time removed
to Worcester, became connected with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
noted paper there, the &#8220;Massachusetts Spy,&#8221; at
length accumulated a handsome fortune, for the
times, much of which, after a long life, he bequeathed
to the Antiquarian Society of Worcester,
and a portion to Harvard College, and other
literary institutions. He was the founder, also,
of the American Antiquarian Society. He became
a writer and educator of much repute.
</p>
<p>
Upon the breaking out of the Revolutionary
war, Mr. Ezra Lunt was the first man who volunteered,
in the meeting-house, when the minister,
Rev. Mr. Parsons, exhorted his parishioners
to military service; was chosen captain of
the company, with which he was present in
command at Bunker Hill, and afterwards was
raised to the rank of major. He took part in
the battle of Monmouth Court House, when
the British army, under Sir Henry Clinton, retired
with much difficulty and loss before Washington,
and used to relate the particulars of the
well-known rebuke administered by that great
chief to General Charles Lee for his hasty retreat
from the advanced post, which had been
assigned him. He declared himself to have
been close by at the moment, and to have
heard the energetic language used on the occasion.
After the war, he received his allotment
of land, and settled upon it, at Marietta, Ohio.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mycall was a person of much natural
capacity and shrewdness, with certain eccentricities
of character, and kept up a little politic
mystery about himself. He once engaged a
well-known carriage-maker of the day to build
him a chaise, which it was agreed should be
finished at a certain time. When the specified
period arrived, the vehicle was not forthcoming.
Enduring a similar disappointment several
times, and expressing himself strongly about it
to the offender, that individual promised it to
him positively at a certain date, <i>if he was alive</i>.
Even then, it was not delivered; but what was
the astonishment of the faulty party to read in
his newspaper the next morning, &#8220;Died, yesterday,
P. B., chaise-maker,&#8221; etc. In a state of
boiling indignation he rushed to the street, and
on the way to the office of publication called
the attention of various acquaintances to the
wrongful statement, which, it appeared, no one
had observed. Entering the office, he inquired,
with much feeling, how Mr. Mycall could have
published such a paragraph. &#8220;Did you not
promise me,&#8221; said the editor, &#8220;that my chaise
should be sent home, on such a day, if you
were alive?&#8221; &#8220;Well, supposing I did?&#8221;
&#8220;Why, then, of course, you must be dead!&#8221;
Taking up a copy of the paper from his desk,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and examining the obituary notices, &#8220;But,&#8221; said
the editor, &#8220;there is no such statement here.&#8221;
The bewildered chaise-maker hastened home to
examine his paper anew; and it appeared, on
inquiry, that the account of his decease was
printed only in his own copy; a gloomy jest,
which was soon much relished by the community.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the town became for a time a noted
place for the publication of standard works, and
books of various descriptions. It was here
that the well-known Mr. Edmund M. Blunt,
who subsequently removed to the city of New
York, published his valuable and famous
&#8220;American Coast Pilot,&#8221; and, afterwards, the
no less useful &#8220;Practical Navigator.&#8221;

In attestation of the remark, on page <a href="#LN_antiquated">144</a> of

many English words prevailed long in New
England, after it was disused in Old England,
and was brought by the colonists from the
Mother Country, see the criticism of &#8220;Holofernes&#8221;

In closing this Appendix, which might be
extended to almost any length, as recollections
which did not occur to me in writing the body
of the work come up, I cannot omit a remarkable
use of the American language, let us say,
since the Czar once so denominated the English
tongue. It was upon the part of a town constable,
perhaps as nearly of the Dogberry type
as could be imagined. I was standing in the
town hall, at a moment preliminary to a public
meeting. A knot of youngsters had been joking
one another, when this authoritative official
approached. All but one speedily retired before
the awful presence. &#8220;Master Constable&#8221;
addressed the lingerer: &#8220;<i>Disperge</i>,&#8221;&mdash;a difficult
operation for an individual,&mdash;&#8220;<i>disperge</i>, I
say; we can&#8217;t have no <i>burlash</i> here!&#8221;

Even Shakespeare might have been glad of
such an opportunity to enlarge the cacology, by
actual hearing, of some of his most amusing
characters.
